"I have never once encountered a traffic jam on my bike path."
<br><br>
Ever been on campus at 10:50? I kid, the bike 'traffic' I encounter is nowhere close to what I've experienced in a car, and this is at a campus where most people commute by bike and can park right next to their classes. 

<br><br>

The part where Ken mentions bike infrastructure in particular stuck with me because I have experienced both the worst and the best in bike infrastructure. Back in my home town, Morgan Hill (where Specialized is headquartered), the best "bike lane" is just the shoulder of the road, and only recently did the busy downtown area introduce sharrows that allow bikes to use the lane. Even then, sharrows (used everywhere in SB) have actually been shown to be less safe than no bike lane at all! I was fortunate enough to visit Copenhagen last summer, and there, I for once truly felt safe riding a bike on the road. The main difference is that the bike lane is elevated slightly above the cars, but below the sidewalk. Then, parked cars are placed to the left of cyclists. This makes the bike lanes feel way safer than they do in the US. The feeling (and of course the reality) of safety is very important to getting people to ride bikes for their commute. You'll see many people ride on the sidewalk on the US because they feel unsafe on the road. Also, the part where Ken mentioned that 4 cyclists have been killed on Modoc is chilling. I don't commute on there, but race bikes and often find myself on Modoc on training rides. The turn from Modoc onto the bike path is extremely unsafe too, completely unprotected and having to get into a lane of car traffic going 45 mph. 
<br><br>


After watching this lecture, I feel inspired to go beyond being a regular cyclist to being a cycling advocate/activist in the truest sense (I say this knowing there are many 'cycling advocates' that are detrimental to cyclists rights on the road). There are many large group rides that take place in cities where cyclists take over and rule the city streets, and now I'm very much inclined to join those as well as regular protests concerning the role bikes can have on the climate. 
<br><br>


As for becoming politically active, I encourage everyone to carefully research the local candidates for this election cycle. Bruce Porter's signs are everywhere, but he will act against the climate goals of the county and has been involved in a phony voter registration scheme called "Rock the Vote SB". I'm sure there are other local candidates that are similarly questionable, so please study the candidates for a bit before coming to the polls.

I too agree that this video inspires my to become a more frequent biker and participating in climate activism. And it's important to emphasize that we need to do our research for candidates that support better roads for biking, transits. We need to actively participate in local to national election. I don't think many people see that voting affects our lives. People who choose to abandon their cars, commute to work by bike are going to do so if the road structures protect them as cyclist. We need to VOTE in addition to our lifestyle changes!

I agree with your comment about how the bike infrastructure bit of the lecture stuck with you, it stuck with me too. I constantly feel myself wishing that I could bike more places. I enjoy being outside and staying active, and biking lets me have both. Hearing about Ken’s electric bike made me really want one. I had never really seriously considered before the possibility of using a bike as a legitimate form of long distance transportation. It was so interesting to hear about how effective simply just advocating for better bike paths could be for the environment. Of course, as Ken mentioned, there are many places in the United States that are too expansive to be able to bike everywhere. But certainly in smaller cities, if we could achieve better bike paths, this could make a huge difference. 
<br><br>

 I also really agree with you when you said that the video made you want to be a cycling activist. I didn’t know bicycle activism was something that existed. And as for the main question the lecture poses, I think it’s kind of loaded. Personal action, climate activism and political activity are all important, but I think it starts with personal action. There is a book by Jonathon Foer called “We are the Weather” that talks about how our food affects the climate (which we have talked about extensively in this class), and how climate activism begins at the dinner table. I think if I had to make a list, the second most important thing would be climate activism. We can see this in someone like Greta Thunberg (among many others), who have helped spear-head a massive youth-lead environmental movement.
<br><hr>
I completely agree! It's cool that you've been to Copenhagen to be able to see just how the bikers feel safety there. When I was in high school, we used to have one specific day a year called "bike to school day" where, just as the name sounds, we would bike to school. There would be organized "bike pool" locations where people who lived in grouped neighborhoods would get together in the morning and bike over. These events were not successful, however, simply because the roads in my hometown were just really not meant for bikers. I think, like Ken mentioned in his example of Copenhagen, we need to mobilize in support of new infrastructure. It was obviously cost a lot of money and will be a lot of time until all the necessary developments are made, but I think this step will be setting us up for success and reduced carbon emissions in the future. 
<br><br>


I think it's absolutely essential that we organize in effective ways. While protests and marches are good for morale and displays of what you believe in, I wonder what politicians think of them. I wonder if there are better ways to be activists. I know people suggest calling the office of our local politicians, but after all, we are just one person calling, which makes the whole thing seem futile. I want to ask Ken (and others on this thread) are there other ways to mobilize, maybe so that we end up actually getting change to occur.
<br><hr>
First off, thank you for your encouragement to people to vote and to vote informed! It is so important to take the little bit of time to look at what candidates are really supporting, even if this may be contrary to party lines or what seems to be the most supported choice among friends and peers. I had a very similar experience of riding a bike on a separated path in Paris this past fall. Living in such an insanely crowded city, I realized that infrastructure greatly influences how people choose (or can't choose) to get around. The narrow streets make driving very difficult and there was always insane traffic, especially on the streets running parallel to the Seine river. But I was amazed by the separated bike lane that ran alongside it, which always got me to where I was trying to go at least twice as fast as it would've in a car, had I even had access to driving while living there. It felt much safer than I ever felt biking around my hometown in California or even on unprotected shoulders in Santa Barbara, where the number of cars was fewer and the streets wider. That physical barrier between me and the cars made such a huge difference, and honestly, being able to bike anywhere was so much more liberating than dealing with car traffic and parking. This also helped me realize that when forced into circumstances where modes of transport or certain lifestyle choices are unavailable, people will adjust and adapt. I, who firmly believed she could never survive without her car, used only bikes, trains and the metro for 5 months simply because it was available to me. As more and more people make personal lifestyle changed, organize from a grassroots level and pressure politicians to make climate action happen, everyone else will follow once it is mandatory. I truly think this it the only way to get the majority of people to make changed: they have to be forced to, but then they will adjust accordingly.

I totally agree with your comment wholeheartedly. The entire bike culture in the United States is underfunded, underappreciated, and looked down on, but I don’t see why. The bike industry is way better for the environment and less traffic, what's not to like? My step dad bikes to work everyday (with a helmet on), but I still get worried everyday that something might happen to him on his way to work because there aren’t good bike lanes. This leads to the political part of the climate crisis because we all need to vote on someone who would make bike lanes a necessity. After watching this lecture, I too feel inspired to sell my car and switch to biking. However, it is scary putting your life in the hands of all these reckless drivers on the highway. One day I think with better bike lanes more people will switch to biking to help save the planet!
<br><hr>
I was also inspired to bike more in the future, I think it is a simple and good thing to do considering the fact that most of the places I frequent are within a 20 mile radius from my house. I was also amazed by how much emissions were lowered following Copenhagen’s switch to safer bike paths (allowing for, and encouraging, more biking). I would love to see Santa Barbara, and all cities in the U.S., create better and safer bike paths. It would really help to motivate people to bike more and drive less, and considering how much Copenhagen lowered its emissions, it would be exciting to see how much the U.S. could reduce its own emissions. Overall, I fully intend on looking into candidates who support aggressive climate activism and I am excited to vote and hopefully see changes in our future.
<br><hr>
I felt the same way after watching this lecture video, I have always wanted to do many things that are environmentally healthy, but too scared to do many of them because of the lack of safety, resources, or money to those alternatives, an example being bicycling. I can easily use an electric bike as my alternative to not having a car, I'd rather have a bike than car because of how much time and money it takes to actually invest in a car. But my biggest worry is definitely safety, and I see it all the time in major cities and crowded areas, such as San Francisco and UCLA. I remember being in UCLA to pick up a friend and seeing all the students using the electric scooters on the car lanes, worried about how some of the students are not signaling or merging in with the cars going 15-25 miles per hour on those crowded university streets. It is wonderful to see how many students want to ride bikes or electric scooters, but it just terrifies me to think that one of them is going to get hurt, or worse.

That is where being politically active comes in, just like how you stated we NEED to research, dig deep into who we are planning to vote for, and make a change. Local, state, and national levels are all important, if you can't make a change in the national, you most DEFINITELY can make a huge impact in state and local levels. We need a mix of all three: personal action, climate activism, and political action, or else we won't get what we want from this fight. Like how Ken said, since cycling can create a big impact on changing our climate for the better and change how our society runs, then why wait or be hesitant? I want to cycle, but because of the lack of attention to bike safety and emphasis on making our nation green again, car usage will only rise more and more. So let our voices be heard, go out there and vote, and express what you want from your politicians.


<br><hr>
I agree that this video is inspiring. I too felt like I owed more and that I could be a better participant in climate activism. But the biggest inspiration matter of fact to me was being politically active. While I knew how big of an impact voting made politically I never stopped to think about how powerful it could be for climate change. With this new realization, I want to spread that and help other people be more knowledgable about what is going on. By emphasizing and doing our research on which candidates will put climate crisis as a priority I truely believe that we can make a difference in that way. It is all about participating actively in local and national elections, we need to fight for the change we want to see.
<br><hr>
Indeed the main lesson for this video is to advocate, pressure, and vote for candidates on board with the fight against climate change. I particularly enjoyed your perspective on the issue as it sounds as though you have much experience with biking under various circumstances. My experience with bike lanes in Orange County precisely the unsettling conditions mentioned time and time again in the video. Less than 2 feet away from me are 2 ton death machines traveling with twice my velocity, and probably 200 times my momentum. Doing the right thing in terms of transportation should not compromise my safety to such an extent. One of the most stunning things I saw in a video presenting UCSB was the sheer number of bikes being utilized! I thought it was beautiful and being here in a community of cyclists certainly adds to the enriching experience of attending as an undergraduate.
<br><hr>
I feel the same! I live in FT and there are some days that my lungs can’t handle going up the all the hills, (I have asthma lol), so I tend to take the bike path on the street. There’s a section of it where I’m legit in between two cars and it’s kind of scary to think that one of them could’ve easily not seen me and changed lanes last minute and boom, no more biking for me. Besides those days, when I do take the bike path that’s closer to the apartments, so after the sidewalk, I feel safer there and more willing to bike. When I went home for the first time over winter break, it felt weird to not have my bike with me to go places, my parents even gave me an odd look when I grabbed my sister’s bike and went to the store, when I easily could’ve taken the car. I didn’t feel as safe doing it back home because they don’t have the same bike paths that I take here on my way to campus, let’s hope that gets better in the future. The little changes that I’ve made to how I do things now compared to how I did them before I took this class, bring about many conversations with my parents and family back home, which opens the opportunity of me passing on this information to more people hoping they too start doing the same
<br><hr>
It's important to note that popularizing bikes will only make these jams even worse. Sometimes I'm too scared to ride my bike in the morning in fear that I will accidentally hit a fellow student and cause a domino effect across the entire school. This is why, as you mentioned, changing our current infrastructure is vital.  Bigger, safer bike lanes will incentivize a lot more people to use biking as a means of transportation. Now  that you have mentioned it, I never have felt truly safe riding my bike in the states. Where I am from, bike lanes are practically nonexistent and Goleta is not significantly better. Had it not been a relatively small college town, with almost zero parking , biking here would probably be the same exact way.  Nevertheless, I really like the concept of using new, cleaner means of transportation and how we can implement it sometime in the future. I do wish to visit Copenhagen one day and experience these blissful bike paths myself.
<br><hr>
I agree that the current bike infrastructure is really an issue. When biking near the cars lane, it always makes me feel unsafe about the trip, especially when the car speed is over 35 mph. It is an urgent problem for us to let the politicians know what we need. After all, these politicians are the people making policies. The most obvious way to achieve our goal is by voting. We can research the backgrounds of those politicians to see if they are supporters for biking. In addition, we need to act as climate activists and let them know we demand for more bike infrastructure and safer places to ride on. We need to show them that the current infrastructure is flawed and far from enough. Only the combination of personal and collaborative actions could take us to the reverse of the climate crisis. For other areas like fracking, we too need to take both types of actions. We should not only limit our use of related products, but we should also vote for politicians that are possibly going to help us banning fracking.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment about the bike traffic here on UCSB's campus. This is a school where the majority of students ride bikes everywhere and although I have been in bike "traffic" I have never once been in a traffic jam like those that are very frequent on freeways and other high populated roads. I think this just goes to show that using a bike is actually very convenient and like Ken mentioned it is even a workout. Biking to class and back everyday may not seem like much of a workout but it is a lot more demanding on your body then sitting back in a reclined chair with the seat warmers on in a car. However, on the other hand, as Ken also mentioned, biking is considered somewhat unsafe due to the infrastructure provided for bikers. I both agree and disagree with this argument. I definitely agree that the current  transportation infrastructure heavily supports the use of vehicles but I don't think it really makes riding a bike any less safe than being in a vehicle. Automobiles kill so many people every year and vehicle on vehicle collision is a way more frequent cause of death when compared to vehicle on bicycle. These numbers are also very skewed given that there are way more cars on the road then bikes but my point is just get out there and get on a bike its really not that unsafe when compared to driving a car on the 405. 
<br><br>

Lastly I think that it is very important that we get more and more people to vote in the incoming elections as that seems to be the most effective way to put a halt to the climate crisis. Like the process that occurred in the city of Copenhagen, we need to attack these policies at the local level first. Once changes are made at a smaller level they can begin to build up and affect larger and larger areas.

<br><hr>
I do agree with you that the desirability  of biking is largely dependent on how safe people feel. I also noticed another problem that manifests itself in the US, the distance. Being an exchange student from the Netherlands, where there are literally more bikes than people, you can bike across the whole country if you want to. I live in the fourth biggest city and It takes me 45 minutes to get from one side to the other by bike. Also the infrastructure is completely built for biking, in many cities you are faster by bike. This encourages people to actually use a bike instead of using a car. Here in the US this is different though. The distances are way bigger. ALthough this is the case I do think that the solution is to start small. Just take a bike-ride instead of your normal car ride to the grocery store. Often it is not that far and you also get in a bit of exercise. Changing the infrastructure and political regulation of car use is a long shot in the US but this should eventually be the goal, therefore, vote wisely!
<br><hr>
During the beginning of this course I was thinking how important it is for us all as individuals to live a healthy lifestyle and lower our carbon footprint. But the main problem is the huge corporations that are pumping huge amounts of pollutants into the environment. In the lecture video It explains how fracking releases an insane amount of methane. This is the frustrating thing, even if I do my best and eat. Somewhere in the world some corporation is just pumping a ridiculous amount of co2 and methane into the environment. It makes me think that the most important thing is just to elect climate activists into office. 
<br><br>


The most important thing to do is VOTE. This is so true. We need all the students at UCSB to vote in 2020 and all young people. This struck home for me as this election this year is the first time I will ever be able to vote. I cant wait to vote for the first time. Without a doubt what I learned in this course will aid me in my decision on who to vote for. I was pretty surprised Ken rides his bike to class. That is super cool and shows his dedication. Copenhagen is a huge bike city in Denmark. We need more bike lanes in So-Cal! They lowed CO2 by 3.8 billion. That's amazing and it also makes for a much more healthy society.


<br><hr>

I agree with your comment. I think however than what Ken was trying to say was that biking in general to campus and finding a parking spot is better than that of using a car. Yes, there is traffic on the bike path but to a less extend than a car traffic. At least you are not stuck for like two hours on the bike path as you would be on the freeway. Anyways, I can understand that local authorities have not fully or better introduced bike lanes for bikers. It is super dangerous to bike on the street bike lines as you are biking alongside the cars which is really scary. This is why I often prefer to take the bus or walk to different places rather than use my bike to go out. Government officials should instead implement bike paths like the ones in Copenhagen. As you described, they are slightly above the cars which generates a feeling of security on people that ride their bikes. Many of the people I know refuse to bike as they feel insecure about using their bikes as a mean for transportation. Therefore, i also conclude that we need to create a feeling of security of our community about biking and provide them with better bike paths.
<br><br>

Ken also talks about environmental activists who have been responsible for dramatic changes such as the ones in Copenhagen that have helped reduced CO2 emissions worldwide and saving us from catastrophe. Other countries should follow Copenhagen's campaign to reduce emissions as we would drastically save our world. We cannot rely on personal activism but rather in a more collectively activism where everyone participates for the greater good. Don’t get me wrong as taking personal action can lead to a sequence of small changes in our lives and maybe to changes in other few people, but if we do this, it will take forever for the entire world to change the way they live and we do not have such time. We need to become the environmental activists of tomorrow to preserve our planet and the Green New Deal proposes a way to do so. We just need to have the courage to change our lives.
<br><hr>


I don’t bike at UCSB, because as of right now that doesn’t make sense for me as an international student, however I use HOPR every now and then (it’s pretty okay, even though it doesn’t work like 10% of the time) and try to walk or use the SBMTD instead of taking an UBER or a Lyft (after all I’m as broke as any college student). However, your comment resonates with me because in my home city of São Paulo our former mayor introduced hundreds of bike lanes throughout the city in similar fashion to what they are here in SB. It was a highly controversial policy, people argued that no one would use them, or that they would become abandoned and local government wouldn’t take care of it, and for the most part people were right. A lot of the bike lanes went unused because they were created in regions that didn’t make any particular sense, and after a little while a lot of the lanes were littered with dangerous potholes, which caused many bad looking bike accidents.

<br><br>

My point with this isn’t that the bike lanes shouldn’t have been created in the first place, but that there should have been a proper study of the city and some regular maintenance installed. My mom, my stepdad, several family friends and thousands of other paulistanos use their bikes to commute to work, or to visit downtown and explore the city and they should be afforded the right to do it safely. Everytime my mom says she’s going on a bike ride, I get super anxious until the moment I see her get back, because to me riding a bike in the city is the single most terrifying experience ever. This makes me very happy that yourself and others are willing to advocate for this cause, and inspires me to do the same.

<br><hr>
Finally! Someone who probably knows where Hollister is! Our reliance on cars can definitely be seen by the fact that people commute to the Silicon Valley all the way from Hollister. It used to be just Morgan Hill and Gilroy but it's moving even farther south. I hate how many houses are being built and the fact that traffic from San Jose during rush hour is nearly 3 hours for barely 40 miles. I think it's interesting how many citizens of Hollister dislike the ever increasing amount of houses yet I've seen no movements of opposition. I remember seeing a lot of stuff on fracking a couple years ago but I couldn't even tell you what the vote was in favor for without looking it up. Ken's thoughts have made me realize that change should happen in all areas, including small ones. Change can be brought to even the smallest of towns, including mine. I hope Hollister can take steps in a different direction and be more environmentally conscious. I know I am going to do to my best to make that happen and I agree that everyone should be encouraged to do the same in their towns.

<br><hr>
I think about bike paths often and their potential impact they could have on the climate. I remember the first week of this quarter I heard someone get into a bike accident at one of the bike loops that required the ambulance to come. And the ambulance had to deconstruct this person’s bike because they were stuck in it. I think there is something about the safety of a car feeling like your body is protected. But in reality, car crashes are one of the top deaths that occur most frequently. If bike paths were reconstructed in a safer way as you described so nicely in Copenhagen, this would dramatically reduce our vehicle emissions. And instead of highways reconstructing roads to produce less traffic, we should be spending our money on creating more vast and easier to use bike paths. I also believe that researching local candidates is huge for becoming politically active. This will make you feel more close to the issue, versus on such a national scale. If we see the problems that SB itself is trying to combat, it will help us feel like we are making a change for the whole world.

Climate activists Naomi Klein has suggested that "focusing on individual consumer behavior whether it's changing light bulbs or going vegan is just not going to get us there," which indicates that changing our personal behaviors is not enough to solve this climate crisis, and we need to do more. For example, even though everyone on the planet gives up eating animal products that would significantly reduce global methane emissions, fracking is the bigger methane problem we cannot solve through personal action. The effective way to solve this sobering situation is to vote and become politically active calling for legislation to end fracking. Every American who is 18 years old and older has the right to vote, and I believe this is their privilege to help mitigate climate change by casting your vote to candidates who advocate for sweeping climate change policies. People who have been given this right should cherish it because not everyone has this privilege. In my country, China, we don't have the right to vote for the candidate we like. Ken then describes the example of how bicycle activism made a huge difference in Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, nearly two-thirds of people commute to work or school by bike. Copenhagen's remarkable bicycle transformation is largely caused by bicycle environmental activists. They strongly demand better infrastructure and safety for the city cyclists. As you mentioned in your comment,  the feeling of safety and better bike infrastructure are very important for getting people to ride bikes for their commutes. Sometimes, people are willing to ride bikes due to the concern of carbon emission, but the reality (unsafe and bad infrastructure) prevents them from doing that.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that bike lanes aren’t completely safe. I live in Los Angeles and I have witnessed that there have been more bike paths put in these recent years. But rarely do I see anyone using these bike paths, probably because of how dangerous they are. Streets in Los Angeles are really narrow and there’s always traffic. I could not imagine biking in these designated bike lanes without fearing for my life. Not to mention that LA drivers drive very aggressively. I think cities need to plan and design safer bike lanes, like you mentioned about Copenhagen, cars should not be able to cross bike lanes so easily. We can’t really expect people to ditch their cars and opt for bikes when our bike lanes are so dangerous. Getting into a vehicle collision while riding a bike is definitely way more lethal than a car on car collision. 
<br><br>

I also feel inspired to become a cycling advocate/ activist. Hearing about the large group rides that happen in the cities inspires me to join the movement also. Not only is biking beneficial to our health, but to our planet as well. I also agree with you that we all need to carefully research the local candidates for this election cycle. It is so important to become informed about the current running politicians. If you’re going to vote without researching first, then you might as well not vote.

<br><hr>


I agreed with this comment initially because I have been in so many bike traffic jams on campus and it is hilarious. On a more serious note safety is for sure something that is very important when trying to advocate people to switch to biking. I personally live in Goleta and work downtown but do not even consider biking because it feels extremely dangerous especially when I get off work around 12am and its pitch black along those main roads so I am not yet convinced I should be biking. It is terrifying and that's why I believe the first step is to elect officials who want to make safe bike paths and have the priority of safety of the people and the climate. With that said if you are biking along roads please wear a helmet. 
<br><br>
Comparing countries is very complicated because politically homogeneity and level of diversity, as well as electoral systems and a hundred other factors, play a part in our representation as well as our efficiency in getting bills passed. However, it does reveal room for improvements and we should challenge each other to be better and kinder to each other as well as the environment..
<br><hr>

It is very interesting to see what you mentioned in Copenhagen that the biking lanes is lifted a little bit above the driving lanes and parked cars are like a protecting wall to make the cyclists feel even safer. Definitely this is what we should learn from Copenhagen, as U.S rarely have biking lanes especially in suburban areas. Santa Barbara actually already did very well in this part, though still not enough comparing with Copenhagen. We do have biking lanes and most students ride a bike or take a bus to school, which is environmentally friendly. However, in most of the cities with fewer population, you can rarely see even one person using bicycles or buses for commuting, as this is real inconvenient and as you mentioned, there was even no biking lanes there. People can hardly feel safe when biking. So if we want to change the situation, adding safe biking lanes to the roads is a very important part. People will hesitate to bike if they cannot feel safe and they are economically sufficient to afford a car.

<br><hr>
Thanks SO much for bringing up the importance of researching candidates on the ballot. Porter truly would NOT be a climate champion. I am not endorsing Hartmann either, rather emphasizing how important it is to research candidates and form your own opinions based on their policies. 
<br><br>

Anyways, climate action. I am a big believer (and have mentioned many times in my comments) that even though personal action, it's not enough without systemic, political action. I feel like your comment on how you feel inspired to take up more action by becoming a cycling advocate is a great example of a way to get involved. I think its possible for anyone take take more action if they find something they are particularly passionate/interested in. It seems like you found your interest in cycling and I know I definitely found mine in environmental/social justice. Although they seem like rather different topics, they are relatively intertwined if you think about it and action on both of those is very important. A lot of times, I'd say, personal action can lead people into political action. They are all important aspects of climate action, but I really do think that political action is the most important because it's vital to make sure we tackle climate change at the root of the problem. Tackling things like wealth inequality and racial injustices is extremely important when it comes to the climate crisis and one way we can achieve that is through political action--which can happen through a grassroots (bottom-up) movement and with our vote.
<br><hr>
The “biking system” in this country is not good enough for many people to bike wherever they want to go. Like what you said, at UCSB, there are a lot of people biking to go to class, and even though the biking traffic is not good, it is still better than the car traffic. There are many of us taking the bus to school and some of us driving. I get why there are people choose to drive to school sometime. I, being the one who takes the bus to school, would sometimes feel so frustrated about taking the bus. There is not enough space for all the students to get on the bus and sometimes the bus will not even stop. We will just watch the bus passing by. Even with that situation, I still did not choose to bike. It does not seem safe for me to bike next to the cars where there are no biking lanes, or the biking lane is so close to the car traffic. Back to the Green New Deal for the film, I feel like the government could help with this kind of change just at least help a little of this situation.
<br><hr>
I so agree with you, especially i am right in a place that nearly every students on campus are commute by bike. This video really inspire me to become a biker and be a member of climate activism. After watching ken's lecture video, now I really want a bicycles and be a member of reducing climate change.Moreover, it is also important to do research about candidates that will encourage to build bike trail and something like this. More importantly, we need to call more people in to actions, to encourage more people to join in us, to be a part of climate activists. This will make our campaign more efficient and more effective,
<br><hr>
Yeah I think the encouragement of using other modes of transportation besides cars is a good start. I think part of the problem with people not practicing good environmental principles is that maybe they think their impact does not mean anything. They may think that if they are just one person out of billions that is vegan or does not own a car that their actions do not mean anything. This is not the case. While one person may not immediately make that much of a difference toward a change, they can definitely be a spark that leads to a raging fire. I mean Rosa Parks was a big activist in the civil rights movement and one of her first challenges to the social hierarchy was just her not wanting to give up her seat on the bus. I can just one person to set an example for others to support.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. The construction of infrastructures for public transportation is the most important issue in making more people change their habits into a greener means of transportation.
<br><br>

I live in Shanghai, a city famous for having serious traffic jams. The government has come up with several methods to cope with the issue, some of which worked, some didn’t.
<br><br>

One of the successful ways to mitigate the problem is to reduce the number of cars on the street. The government came up with a couple hundred license plates each month that are distributed to the hand of car owners in a special auction. Though I heard quite a lot of complaints, it largely decreases people’s desire to own a car by increasing the cost of time and money.
<br><br>

The other method didn’t go well like that. The department of public transportation picked one of the busiest main roads and set up a special bus track under the highway. Sounds very feasible, I would have approved that proposal if you asked me. But the new bus lane caused inconvenience instead of speeding up the effectiveness of transportation. Firstly, cars are not allowed on the special lane and thus the traffic jam was made worse. Secondly, the reason why people wouldn’t give up their car and use the express bus is that since they’re built under the highway, it’s time consuming to get to the bus station——you need to cross the street miles away from the bus stop and then find your way back. What’s worse, because it was solely planned, it’s hard to transfer to another bus or subway—you can’t even get a taxi because no cars are allowed on express bus lanes!
<br><br>

We should urge the government to better the public transportation system, and what’s more, we should make sophisticated plannings beforehand so that it doesn’t go to waste.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you regarding the importance of infrastructure. I fear riding bikes on main streets in the US just because it feels so unsafe. The way Copenhagen is designed to support cyclists and bicycling is a remarkable move for the betterment of the environment as bikes obviously don't emit harmful gases into the atmosphere that cause climate change the way cars do. I'm also from LA, where the public transportation system is quite awful. If the public transportation system, as well as infrastructure to support bicycling was better and if more funding was put toward it, it would be a great move for the future of the planet as it would entail less people driving cars and thus much less greenhouse gas emissions, as cars account for 1/4 of emissions. This is also why voting is important, as funds being allocated to such developments would have to be initiated by a politician and we must vote for politicians who have environmentalist approaches if we want to see change.
<br><hr>
I really like your enthusiasm to become a bicycle activist/advocate. I feel like everyone can find something in their life that they feel strongly about and become an advocate for that certain thing. Especially here at UCSB. Whether its advocating for better bicycle infrastructure, fighting climate injustices and inequality, or signing people up to vote, i think there is something for everyone to do in regards to the climate crisis. As Ken mentioned in the lecture, you do not have to be famous or high in status to be an activist. You just have to be passionate. It is also important that you make all the changes you can in your personal life to cut your carbon footprint. In other words, practice what you preach. Along with becoming an activist, you can go out to vote and advise others around you to do the same. As an activist, it is also important to support politicians who put people ahead of corporate interests. We need to elect more politicians who will actually listen to what we want in regards to climate policies. These upcoming elections are game changing. Now is the time to start being a climate activist and informing people about the climate crisis. Hopefully, the next lectures on climate communication can help with tips on how we can  spread the message to others.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, bike traffic is nowhere near as bad as car traffic. Personally I also find it more convenient walking or biking it to campus rather than using a car or even taking the bus. The bike paths here at UCSB are really convenient and are efficient in getting us to our exact location. However if i would use a car I would have to waste time parking and then walking to my destination; and this is not considering the cost of gas as well. Also, if I were to bus it to campus instead, at times it takes a while just waiting, or it takes too long dropping off and picking up people at each stop. I completely agree with you as well with voting and becoming involved. Choosing the right candidates is essential for solving issues involving climate change. This is evident in the Green New Deal; it’s a great step towards finding solutions for the near future, but it just needs the right backing and support from the public. If we get efficient officials through voting we can see more plans like these and can solve this crisis before its too late.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with the fact that the bike infrastructure just flat out sucks here. In UCSB alone it is not the greatest. At 10:50 you will encounter insane traffic, I've almost been in three bike accidents this year alone. Riding a bike can be quite enjoyable if there was the right infrastructure for it. Like the fact the school fixed the path behind the chemistry building makes a huge difference. I personally hate riding my bike on the street because I worry i'll get hit so I either ride the bus or ride my bike on the sidewalk for a small amount of protection from cars. This is definitely something that could be fixed if we actually pushed for it.
<br><hr>
I agree that improving bike infrastructure is important for decreasing the carbon footprint in transportation as it promotes biking.  However, in suburban areas like where I'm from, even improved biking infrastructure will most likely not make a considerable change in the amount of bicyclists.  There are too many very large hills, and some people live up to 8 miles from the high school.  Not everyone can afford an expensive electric bike or at least have the incentive to buy one, especially when considering how cold it is in the mornings, which can make people sick, especially when they have to exercise in that environment.  Another proposal would be to improve the busing, but missing the bus and missing class can effect grades, and too many buses would be required to cover such a large area which can make the effort worthless if the buses do not carry enough people to reduce the carbon footprint compared to driving a car.  Therefore, my question is what legislation or infrastructure idea can solve this problem in suburban areas like these?

<br><hr>
I agree that there are moments on campus where there is terrible bike traffic but in general it is not like that outside of campus since there usually is not that many bikers on the road at a given time. However, I agree how in most places the best “bike lane” is just the shoulder of the road. When I was in middle school/high school, I found it pretty irritating whenever I was walking on the sidewalk and I would have to move to accommodate them. However, now that I personally bike I get that they are doing that due to there not being proper bike lanes and riding alongside the shoulders is very dangerous. It pains me to hear that there have been cyclists killed on Modoc. I did not know that cycling could be deadly. It makes me want to take a step forward to advocate for this issue. It sucks that even if everyone went vegan, it would not solve the climate crisis. I agree with Ken that voting is the best way to help out with the climate crisis. Thank you,Seth for your encouragement to vote. To be honest, I never saw a Bruce Porter sign but I now know to be more mindful about him. We should all really do our research before we vote for someone.
<br><hr>
My first thought when he said he hasn't faced bike traffic was exactly the same as yours. Bike traffic, in my opinion, is way scarier than car traffic. I've been in a bike accident before, and that is really rough because you have no protection from slamming your body into another person and their metal bike (with many sharp pointy parts). In addition, its almost impossible to ride a normal bike in heavy wind, another problem Ken doesn't need to worry about because he has the electric bike. I think a smart thing to implement in colleges is a community where its easier to travel places by bike like it is here at UCSB. While I have a car here, there's no way I'm going to drive to school unless is pouring rain. But, I know many other campuses where driving there is what most students do multiple times a day. I think being politically involved is one of the most important things to do, as it is a way to change way of life for the masses, which is the only way we can have widespread improvements.

<br><hr>
The first sentence regarding the hectic nature of our bike paths drew me in, and I really resonated with all your points. I have never really thought about how important and effective bike travel is and I also never considered all the issues and risks that come along with this. I had a teacher in high school who would bike to school every day and was known at the school for being the “bike guy.” On the way to school one morning, he was hit by a car on his bike, breaking his collarbone. After this terrible accident, he had no way to get to school every morning as he did not have a car and my city's public transportation is terrible. This man was punished for choosing the environmentally-conscious transportation option. This should not be how it is. This is one of the reasons this topic really hit home for me. Another reason why I feel so strongly about it is the bike culture I've come to love here at SB. Biking is such an integral part of life here and it is not only healthy and fun but guilt-free and good for the environment. I feel no need to have a car here as I bike and bus everywhere I go, but I know this likely will not be the reality once I graduate and relocate. 
<br><br>
I also really appreciated your point about political activism and awareness. I love to advocate for this, but things such as transportation have never been criteria on my mind when thinking about a candidate, as I thought of this as unimportant. Now I realize how much impact such a seemingly small issue can have and how important it really is to research if any given candidate is being sustainable in all the small facets of their campaign.

<br><hr>

I agree 100% with your comment about informed voting! This election is the first I have been able to vote in and I asked my mom who she voted for so I could just vote for the same people. The only problem is she was voting for San Diego county and I registered here in Santa Barbara county, so she told me to look up all the candidates and see what each of them stand for and their past experiences. It made me realize not only how important it is to vote but to do research on who you're voting for. I've walked past many people in the arbor handing out stickers and telling me to vote for their candidate, but it's always surface level and not really about what policies they're planning to put in place. Generally in California and especially Santa Barbara the environment is well valued, but many candidates can find loop holes and make false promises just to get you to vote for them. In addition to voting, like Ken said in the video there is a trifecta of change of our futures: activism, personal changes, and voting. I think it was very eye opening for me to hear Ken talk about how it would be impactful if everyone in the world did 'go vegan' or implement plant-based diets, but it's not going to happen, therefore it's not a realistic solution to put our faith in. This is even more of a reason that people should vote, so we can make concrete changes in things in energy sustainability and infrastructure. We need people in office like the leaders in Venezuela and Copenhagen who made it priority to build safe bike lanes and efficient busses. Again this is one of the reasons I chose to major in ES and am thinking of double majoring in political science. My goal is to go into environmental policy because I think it's so relevant for the current day and so important for the future. The upcoming presidential election scares me for our country as a whole because I'm not very confident that any of the democratic candidates can beat Trump and with him in power the environment is put at even more risk, which puts the rest of the developing world in danger. It is more than just the president that can make changes, if we vote in very willing local leaders then I believe it will slowly but surely help the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I'd have to agree, I live very close to Morgan Hill (South San Jose) and there really are not adequate safety infrastructure investments for bicyclists. I would love to be able to take my bike to work, but I would have to risk riding on a very dangerous path during dark early morning hours. Some of the examples you gave about the danger of cycling only make it more daunting to actually go ahead and do it. I think you are right in advocating for people to do their research on candidates because it is really easy to be mislead and confused if you don't take the time to learn about the policies and issues the candidates are running for.

<br><hr>
I agree, the part about bike infrastructure meant a lot to me. I have lived in 3 different places in my life, the San Fernando Valley, Isla Vista, and Copenhagen Denmark (1 year for study abroad). I frequently biked to get wherever i might have been going in all three locations. In the San Fernando Valley there are bike paths on the shoulders of some, if not most, main roads, but the cars drive 2 feet from you and there's no telling if someone who's changing the music on their phone might accidentally swerve into you, it just feels generally unsafe and I understand why people are discouraged. In Isla Vista I obviously experience all the same things you all do, the bike paths, the abundant parking, but also people biking right through stop signs and biking all over IV drunk (things I am guilty of too). IV is better than most places but still is not a great environment for biking on many occasions, we all have room to improve. In Copenhagen however, the culture is different, people use turn signals when biking, they stop at the stop signs and red lights, they stay on the right side so others can pass them, they're courteous of others. They also have elevated bike paths which physically separates them from the car and a stoplight system that favors bikers over cars. The city of Copenhagen is actually 8 square miles smaller than Santa Barbara and in an entire year of living there, I found that there were only two blocks that ever had regular traffic and that was dead center of the city. Try driving form Goleta to State street between 4 and 6pm and you'll sit through 10 miles of traffic and thats before you even get off the freeway. Infrastructure is very important to creating a bike friendly city but so is the bike culture.
<br><hr>
I thoroughly enjoyed reading your thoughts on the topic. I love cycling, but I have actually found myself walking most places here. I think if everyone started biking or walking, people would benefit in so many different ways. There would be less cars emitting toxic greenhouse gases, and people would receive many health benefits from the exercise that you don't get when you sit in a car and drive. I appreciate your "warning" for this upcoming election and will do my research! Thanks!
<br><hr>
I think bike culture is a potentially huge solution to reducing CO2 admissions along with other parking, infrastructure problems that come with it. I LOVE being at UCSB and think it's so cool how we bike everywhere, to class, to meals, to parties, to the beach. There's something kinds cool about cruising in on my pink Hawaiian flower beach cruiser wherever I go. It not only makes every ride so enjoyable and keeps your body moving, and gives your lungs fresh air to breath, but also natures the clean air that the environment has left, rather than intoxicating it with more CO2. I think our campus is very unique in that it was built around the "bikes go first" rule, and that everyone is so in on either walking, skating, or bike riding wherever a car isn't needed. 
<br><br>
I wish more cities made bike riding as "hip" as it is at UCSB and provided safe systems of bike paths. Where I'm from in Long Beach they recently implanted a long bike path however it is on the street in the same path as cars which doesn't make it very desirable, safe, or efficient. The city has started to renovated the bike path to be directly on the street next to the side walk, and have street parking on the other side of it, so the path is between sidewalk and parked cars, which I think is a creative smart idea. 
<br><br>
I will continue to be a bike advocate, as well as use my voice through my vote through the causes I believe in. I truly believe that every vote counts, and our generation understands things older one's may not about the environment, and our voices need to be heard.

<br><hr>

The part of your comment where you discussed bike infrastructure really resonated with me because I too have experienced some of the best and worst bike infrastructure. Back in the bay area, the bike lane is also just a very narrow strip of land on the road. I very rarely see any bikers and my parents actually didn’t want me to bike because of how dangerous it was. This is very disappointing because of how different things could be if the city just restructured the roads. It was hard going back during winter break because I was used to getting around everywhere on my rollerblades. However, even when I wanted to continue this eco friendly habit back home, it just seemed too dangerous to do it. In addition to this, rollerblading to places would’ve been very inconvenient because the way suburbs are structured, everything is so far apart. This is pretty different from IV where everything is walkable or bikeable. I really wish that the government will take action in investing more into bike infrastructure so people will feel like they have the option to use car alternative transportation.

<br><hr>
This lecture video left me throroughly confused. I had felt that I had had a bit of clarity lately, feeling more confident that individual actions can truly make a difference, that eating a meatless diet was really beneficial, but after this video I an back to square one. I think what I did learn through this video is how truly impactful using our political voice can be. 
<br><br>

That being said, I completely agree with what you left off with on your comment. It is unfortunately a common occurance that people go to the poles and only vote for candidates who have a lot of coverage, simply becuase the voter has heard of the candidate. They often don’t know if what they have heard about these candidates is good or bad but they vote for them regardless. We get a country left in shambles. It is a really important to understand what each candidate is going to try to do, not only for us, but also for the planet. I think it is crucial that we are voting for somebody who believes in the climate crisis and has a plan to help us mitigate its toxic effects. 
<br><br>

It is clear that politics can make a big change in the way that we handle crisises, and we are about to be in the biggest crisis the world has ever had to face. It comes down to us to vote in people that can try to reduce this huge impending disaster and use this huge, leading country as a force to drive the world toward change.

<br><hr>
I agree with your point that safety plays an important part in attracting more cyclists. Some bicycle lanes in my hometown offer an 80 cm guardrail next to the car’s road. And I’m inspired too by Ken’s video describing the impact of bicycle activism. I would say that besides simply propagate on how commuting by bikes could affect the environment, or what global sequences, in general, could riding bikes generate, informing people the positive role commuting by bikes plays on their body health could also be a critical point. 

<br><br>

Some of my mom’s colleague discovered themselves hyperlipidemia or similar abnormal health indicators in their periodically physical examinations. They decided to bike to their office because commuting by bike helped save their time to work out and helped them with the healthier and regular schedule. My dad, as a sports fan, will choose at least one day a week biking to his office using 2 hours, though it usually takes 40 minutes to drive there. He told me that biking in the city gave him a chance to breathe fresh air and visit the historical part of the city in a sense of traveling, which was absolutely a fabulous experience. I’m glad that people could really persist in doing these things, and I believe eventually differences will be made.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that biking infrastructure needs to be upgraded. Last summer I biked to SB with friends and then we couldn’t find a place to park. It reminds me of the previous video about Columbia. They did a great job building wide bike lanes. I lived in a city in China where the bike lanes and the roads are divided by wide bush lines. It looks really fancy and there are almost no car-bike accidents throughout the year because no one drives the car into a bush. Like you mentioned we might encounter traffics on a bike lane but I am pretty sure it only happens on campus. I have never had bike traffic anywhere else. Also, I think mountain biking is an extreme sport and players should know the risk before going into high-speed riding.
<br><hr>
I also agree with your comment about how the bike infrastructure part of the video hit pretty close to home. UCSB is known in the nation as being one of the most bike friendly campuses in the United States, and I’m grateful that the school I chose to attend is taking steps to reduce emissions. Not only has the bike paths on campus promoted environmentally friendly modes of transportation, but it also has promoted having a healthy lifestyle for students to partake in. No wonder our campus has some of the happiest students in the world, the endorphins are always kicking! To tie this back to the climate crisis, having safe and appealing bike lanes would go a long way in terms of promoting environmental sustainability. Not only would it promote environmental sustainability, but also a healthy lifestyle for our mainly obese society. Why not kill two birds with one stone?

<br><hr>
The biking here in UCSB I think is a great way to get around. The traffic however here however is annoying at times. Usually right before the hour is when it’s at its worst. You gotta go somewhat early if you want a clean ride. However even then the biking here is a little unsafe. There are rules to the bike lanes but they aren’t exactly enforced. People never  yield on roundabouts which is scary at times but hey at least everyone one isn’t driving to school. When I’m here I only use my bike to get around. This video and this class as a whole has inspired me to use more sustainable modes of transportation while I’m back home.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in the aspect that we must take responsibility and investigate the candidates we ultimately vote for. Many people trust the ads and campaign slogans that are presented to the public without a second look because they assume that they are being truthful and are representing their values and needs. This sadly is not the case. Growing up I would see signs of the local candidates running and would think that the best person for the job would be the person whose name I saw the most. It is our job to not only educate ourselves, but also others.
<br><br>


As mentioned in the video by Ken our personal efforts that we take will not cut it. Large corporations have guilted us for our actions making us believe that climate change is due solely on our actions. Do not get me wrong I know that there is a fraction responsible for climate change due to our lifestyles, but it is not nearly as large as the expenses of these big corporations. This why it is incredibly important to vote in combination with activism and changing to a more sustainable lifestyle. By doing this we will change the views and values that we demand from our representatives. I also thought it was interesting when Ken mentioned that 28% of methane emissions come from meat, but there is a larger portion that comes from fossil fuel extraction. If we were to elect officials that would be able to help decrease this amount we would have a greater impact on reducing emissions rather than trying to band together in order reduce our personal emissions.

<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion. Safety is important for bicycles. The bicycle looks unsafe. In fact, it does fall on a touch. We can change the external facilities (just like the bike path in Copenhagen) to make people less prone to accidents when cycling. I also agree to participate actively in the voting, even though most people are ordinary people, but we can do our best to change things that are not conducive to mitigating climate change.
<br><hr>
You mentioned that the new "bike lane" that was presented to the people of your hometown turned out to be a lot more dangerous than no bike lane at all. This made me think about the people who make these roads and what kind of restrictions they have. In Copenhagen, it is clear that people took the safety and comfort of cyclists as a priority, but here, it does not seem to be the case. From a certain point of view, it looks like the government simply does not want us to switch to biking. This becomes a little weird when I think about how wealthy these two countries are. The US, with all its budget, is "struggling" to make good biking lanes, while Denmark, with perhaps a little smaller budget, can make everything work. And it is like that with most of the problems related to climate change. Solving these problems is simply not beneficial to a certain demographic, which makes things harder to realize. I am not really sure if there is a way we can fix this... But what we can do is vote. As you said, it is important to carefully research the candidates before giving them your vote, since not a lot of them can be credible. I hope we can find a way to make climate change at least a nation-wide battle so that everyone could be involved. However, this might be too much to ask for now, so we must show all our support to those who are willing to bring the change in the system we have today.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you had to say. I think that biking is a great way for us to help the environment in the simplest way, but we also need to do some improvements to make it safer. Biking next to moving cars is extremely dangerous and could be fatal if struck by a vehicle. We too should have parked cars to the left of the bike lane in order to better protect those who are cycling on the streets. We also need more people to enforce the rules when biking. There are many people who don’t follow the rules and put themselves or other people in danger. I have witnessed many accidents here at UCSB at the roundabout because people don’t understand that they must yield to those who are already in the roundabout. There are also many people biking who ignore the stop signs. They are there for a reason so obey them. As for being politically involved I agree with you, everyone should do their research on the candidates. Make sure you vote for someone who you believe would be making the changes that you want to see.
<br><hr>
I cannot take a car. Im 5'8. A car would wreck me for sure, as it would with most other people, only disclosing the Hulk and He-Man. This being said, I agree: Bike Paths are incredibly important. If we want to boast the idea that switching to walking, biking, or skating to work is a good one, then it has to be something safe for people to do. If we leave people high and dry in terms of bike safety, then they will likely just continue to drive cars. It's easier, and apparently safer. To retreat these ideas from my head, I feel like a better bike system would allow people to get on their bikes and actually get to work. We need to put up a larger bike complex, one that is direct, efficient, permeable, and above all, safe.

<br><hr>
Agreed! We need to push for a better bike info-structure in the US and for politicians to listen to our climate crisis demands (Also, to be careful who we elect, please do research on local candidates).
<br><br>

Coming to UCSB I knew I would need a bike to get around but I had no idea how important it was in the Climate Crisis discussion. I did not think much about it until this class. I'm sorry for how bad that sounds. Thanks you to Ken for calling out my ignorance.
<br><br>

In my city the bike info-structure is essentially non existent so I'm not used to riding my bike to get around. Riding bikes for me was to biking around in your neighborhood, never really venturing out too far because it was dangerous-you could get hit by a car. So I'm not so keen on riding around SB, I just don't feel entirely safe out there. Well after all the talk about Copenhagen you all made me curious to check it out and...it's impressive and awesome. It all looks so safe, well though out, and convenient. All thanks to people for speaking out and pushing for this bike info-structure. I want that. We need that.
<br><hr>
I appreciate you for bringing up the point of researching local candidates for elections. I fear voting in elections brings about a whole nother conversation about cynicism in voting or the belief that your vote doesn’t count. 
<br><br>

I think being politically active is essential to raising the cynicism out of people and show them that there are policies that truly matter and will change the direction that our country is going in. Spreading this political activism would be profound in creating a wave effect in instilling a sense of urgency about the climate crisis in many people who will then hopefully take up political activism and then personal action. 
<br><br>

And advocating for safe bicycle infrastructure isn’t the only way we can be politically active in a way that will combat the climate crisis. We can demand our electricity providers to provide us with clean energy. We can also advocate for better labor laws. There’s many ways we can be advocates that I can argue is also a form of personal action.
<br><hr>
My hometown was very anti biking. Even my parents while driving would still be very annoyed at the fact that cyclists are taking up bike lanes. They would also, of course, give bicyclists as much room as possible just in case. Every time I go back to my hometown, I always feel as though I'm missing biking and just the exhilarating feeling of being in an environment that isn't home or a car and still getting exercise. This is never able to happen because my parents don't think it's safe to bike in my town, and drivers probably wouldn't appreciate another biker on the road anyhow. I wish that bike paths elsewhere were just as safe as they are here at UCSB, but I still do understand the whole concept of "rush hour" that Seth is speaking of. However, this concept is the same as rush hour for commuters who go to work during peak hours. That is detrimental for the environment in itself too. If the US took more of an initiative to bike rather than drive or even use public transportation, I feel as though the world would be in a better condition.

<br><hr>
I really like the idea of being an activist for sustainable transportation because I believe that it is one of the most viable options for everyday people to become active in. Along with the environmental benefits, there are many benefits to have efficient bike lanes. An increase in bike usage would result in people getting more daily exercise, less congestion on major roadways, and less financial burdens associated with driving an automobile. 
<br><br>
As a student at UCSB, bike transportation has always been my go to form of transportation while at school. I never really looked into the realities of being a cyclist on major highways, but Ken brought up a valid point that not many streets are safe for bikers. By simply allocating more road space for bikers, along with providing adequate barriers between bikes and cars, I believe that more people would feel safe enough to integrate bike riding into their daily commutes.

<br><hr>

Bike infrastructure is extremely important. I remember growing up I would walk to my elementary school, but when I started attending my middle school that all changed. It was too far to walk (about 20 minutes which would be doable but farther than I wanted considering how early school starts) and there were no bike lanes on the way there (they just had to share the 35 mph road with cars). I remember one classmate got hit by a car on his bike on the way to school (he was fine), but stories like these made both me and my mom worried about the dangers of biking to school, so my dad started driving me. This continued through the beginning of high school (about a 45 minute walk away) until my junior year when my city did a large reconfiguration of some streets to be more bike-friendly. Once a designated bike lane was created, I felt safe to bike to school. My dad also felt happier because he could sleep in, and no longer had to deal with the traffic surrounding the drop off area. I should also mention that there wasn't a bus that could take me to either school (the only one with the right route ran about an hour before school started because it was not a designated school bus). There are probably many who were in my situation who would prefer a more eco-friendly way to get to school, such as biking or busing, but those reasons weren't viable for them. It is important that people not only make individual decisions to reduce their climate footprint but also vote and be climate activists so that change can happen on a larger level.

I feel like it's not shocking that the comment about the bikes got this may replies... after all, we are on a very bike-heavy campus. I usually bike to class every day. 

<br><br>

But bikes are scary. I'm a reasonably careful cyclist, and I've been in three major accidents since I got to UCSB, resulting in bad cuts, two wrecked bikes, and one hand injury that made it impossible to type for a quarter. And all of these crashes happened on the paths, I'm terrified to drive in the streets.
<br><br>


In high school, a friend of mine got hit and killed by a car on a road that I biked all the time. It was horrifying, and I stopped biking for close to a year.
<br><br>


I guess I don't know if my comment has a reason to exist, but the emotional response that came up for me with a discussion of bike activism is fear. I love biking when it's safe, and I hope that we can change out cultural perspective enough to promote safer lanes.


<br><hr>

Seth mentioned that the bike lanes in Copenhagen are slightly elevated from the street but lower than the sidewalk so they feel a more sense of security from the dangerous traffic. I didn’t know about this but it goes to show that there are so many ways to make a change in the structure of things if you call for a change. If we protested for better bike lanes this could become our reality. The bike paths we have today in America are not safe and make it unappealing for the average person to want to choose it over driving for their daily commute. If it was safer, I believe it would be a different story and that a lot of people would switch to biking in order to save money and time from parking. I remember one time I went biking with two friends of mine on a road with traffic going 50mph and I could not have been more uncomfortable the whole commute and couldn't wait to get home safe. This is unacceptable and fighting for better bike lanes after my experience is when climate activism and politics come into play. Although personal action is very important, I believe climate activism and voting for environmentally conscious candidates is the most important thing to do right now because they can have the biggest impacts in the bigger picture of things. I can personally bike everyday but the bike paths won't be better for all until protests or candidates bring the change.

<br><hr>
I feel the same as well. I was lucky enough to visit Copenhagen last summer as well and noticed lanes dedicated for cyclists. Such thoughtful design is what really promoted cycling in Denmark, unlike ones in SB. I found it terrifying to bike around SB since bike lanes were just simply dotted lines on motorways. I could not count how many cars passing me by with high speed that freaked me out. To culturally change our daily behavior requires coordination from politicians and citizens. And yes we all should vote for our own future.
<br><hr>
I enjoyed reading your personal experience of biking in Copenhagen, which provides me further insights into how that works differently than where we live - the slightly elevated bike path. I also have the same feeling as you do as to the inspiration about being an activist. I also strongly agree with Ken's notion about the need to integrate personal actions and political changes, as both can make a significant difference so we should try our best to promote changes in both ways. Additionally, I also believe that international cooperation is crucial, as environmental problem is shared internationally and the sufferer of this climate crisis is not an individual, a country, or a race, but the whole species Homo Sapiens, and the Earth that raises this species and a variety of other species that comprise our integral and diverse ecosystems. 
<br><br>

I also agree with the flexibility and convenience provided by bikes (in the case of commuting a relatively short distance). I have a friend who owns a car and a motorbike and she usually complains about the parking lot issue on our campus. Once, she drove here and found no parking lot for 10 minutes, and drove back to her apartment and switched to her motorbike. This might sound ridiculous, but this really reveals that bike can be the best choice of transportation. I was also shocked by the amount of CO2 that can be saved by biking. The saving of time, money, and positive externalities from riding bikes makes it distinct that it deserves popularity.
<br><br>

However, when I was in downtown Santa Barbara, I also felt that the infrastructure should be more bike-friendly, as this can be a very forceful encouragement for people to bike, same for public transit and trains that are relatively environmental-friendly ways of transportation. Hence, voting here plays a role, and I agree with Seth saying that pole should study the candidates a bit before coming to the polls, as that can largely affect the future we want to see.
<br><hr>
I enjoyed seeing all the replies to this comment. Directly in response to Seth's comment, biking around the city would be great and extremely beneficial. Although, like he stated we need to have the infrastructure that allows us to do so! For example, Copenhagen. Many people in the US fear riding bikes on the road as they simply do not feel safe. Implementing something like separate bike paths or protective measures on roads for bikers would inspire many to ride a bike. Although the only way that would happen is if there is both personal and governmental action. In fact that's the only way we can really mitigate the climate crisis at all. It takes multiple different actions on multiple different fronts. For example we can have cultural change with people changing toward vegan based diets and we can also have technological changes with things like wind turbine farms and solar. On top of that we can make great political change by voting and taking personal action. 
<br><br>
The Climate Crisis is simply a complex problem that needs a complex and well thought out solution.

<br><hr>

I also agree that after watching this video I feel as if I should start becoming a regular cyclist and start encouraging my friends to do the same. Although due to medical problems I won’t be able to ride a bike for quite some time, but I can still take public transportation and walk different places. And you’re very right it’s very important that we find candidates that support better bike paths and public transportation systems, and it’s sad that many people have the mindset that voting won’t doing anything, but it’s all about who you vote for and the people you put your trust into, not to mention before you go out and vote you should always do your research.

<br><hr>
There is no doubt that the bike traffic on campus can be overwhelming at times. But I have to say that UCSB’s bike path system is well thought and effective. I live at tropicana del norte, located at the upper right corner of iv. Bike path runs in the back of my dorm. I could, actually, get to most locations on campus within five minutes. Yet I don’t even own a bike. My dorm has free annual passes to the hopr bike sharing app. I don’t have to worry about parking my bike when running late for class, and I can use a bike wherever on campus. It is pretty handy. Imagine living off-campus, yet you could rush to Campbell hall for class in 5 minutes.
<br><br>

In regard to the political side of climate change, I don’t have much of a say on this since I am an international student. I do realize the importance of the general public’s vote here in the US. It is important for people to have an opinion on what kind of country one wants. And as the fate of our planet involves politics, we must be ready for the choices we make.

<br><hr>

I think that these all methods should use together. First of all, people should all take part in the action to protect the environment, and they could also ask their family members and their friends to take part in. They should make a change in their daily lifestyle, such as taking public transportation or bicycle for work, living in remote area, and eating more vegetable instead of meat. Also, I think the government should have some policies to protect the climate. Everyone should take efforts to help the climate become better instead of worse and worse.

<br><hr>
I agree with you on wanting to be more of an activist for biking (bicycling). I do like to ride my bike around, it gives me a sense of comfort being able to “work out” a little while going to my desired place. I would love to bike more, not just on campus but in the actual city. Although I do like to bike I never feel safe biking on the streets even if it is a bike lane next to the lanes for cars. There are just too many people who don’t pay attention when driving for me to feel safe when biking next to them. If our county and country made the effort to put actual bike lanes (designated safe lanes) for riders, I feel that more people would be willing to ride a bike, even if it’s to work out, go to the store, go to work, or even visit a friend or family member. If our cities started becoming more efficient for bicycling it would have a huge impact on better helping the environment; taking the first few steps to help save our world.

<br><hr>
I strongly agree with the importance of having a strong sense of security when biking. For the longest time, I had skated everywhere but then this year I decided to finally purchase a bike and what a mess it has been. I have witnessed maybe 4/5 serious bike accidents which could of very easily have been me.  Further, a big problem I find with bike accidents lays in the fact that it is very difficult to acknowledge when someone is breaking and so one someone suddenly breaks the person behind is taken by surprise and doesn't have enough time to break which in turn results in that person colliding with the person in front and this has happened countless of times. Thus, I think investment in greater biking technology, such as a brake light like those implemented in cars, would highly enhance the demand for bikes and would also create a greater sense of security.  Furthermore, as you mentioned, Copenhagen effectively addresses the lack of biking safety by having parked cars placed in between moving cars and bikers. This further encourages people to bike. Furthermore, this lecture really did widen my perspective on how important biking is and it has truly changed my outlook on it.
<br><hr>
After watching this week's lecture video, I felt that there is nothing we can do to mitigate the climate issue through personal action because most human beings are not willing to change their actions voluntarily. However, climate activism really helps people adapt to an environmentally-friendly lifestyle. An example that Professor Ken brought up in his video is the Copenhagens's bicycle transformation.It was brought about by bicycle environmental activists. In Copenhagen, 3.8 billion pounds of co2 were reduced per year, while people switch to bicycling from driving cars. There would be a dramatic impact if the people in the U.S change their lifestyle like the people in Copenhagen.
<br><hr>
I completely agree about doing your research when voting, it's important to understand what each candidate stands for and how they will address certain issues regarding climate change. I think that voting can be one of the most beneficial ways for change to actually occur within the climate crisis. I really enjoyed hearing about Ken's story of commuting to work on his bike, considering how he lives a good 10 miles away from campus. Not many people are keen to the idea of steering away from carbon fueled transportation, but as Ken mentioned it's important to get both family and friends informed on the issue of climate and the importance of voting for policies and candidates that mitigate the climate crisis. I feel as though if in Copenhagen can reduce the amount of cars on the road and a good 62% bike, then perhaps other cities should also implement safer bike lanes as well.

<br><hr>
I totally agree that personal action is not as effective as climate activism. Let us analyze the fact we have. Personal action can have effect if and only if a great number of people doing environmental protection routinely over certain amount of time. Climate activism require only thousands of protesters gathering around for a single afternoon to draw attention from the policymakers. However, there is a second layer of mechanism here. Personal action, despite its great difficulty to carry out, really shrink our carbon footsteps, but climate activism depends on government to decide whether to deal with the problem. The certainty versus uncertainty is quite impressing when Ken referred to Denmark's activism about cycling in 1970s and after two decades the bicycle lanes were finally built in large scales.  Therefore, both ways have difficulties but from my perspectives, the difficulties for the second one is smaller. As one of those who realize the environmental problem, I myself try to obey what is said in the readings about eating indigenous fruit and vegetables instead of meat, but I cannot maintain it in a daily basis. Because indigenous produced things are somewhat expensive( why?) , and I am a heavy meat-addicted. I believe many people are like me. It requires great courage, far more courage than attending activist for a single day, prompting about environmental protection.
<br><hr>
I agree and am so glad that since coming to SB I’ve become a frequent biker.  Before moving here I barely even knew how to ride a bike because where I’m from the streets are busy and the bike lane is so small that it makes it scary to bike (often people would bike on the sidewalk instead.)  I also think it’s important for people to realize just how important voting is, not just nationally but for your city and state as well because that is where we will see the small changes that will make a big difference in our lives and the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I am in my first year at UCSB and up until this year I have never ridden a bike anywhere except when I was in elementary school. I love riding my bike. Yes, cars are more convenient for long distance travel, however I thoroughly enjoy riding mike to school or to run errand. I think the biggest reason for that is the bike path that we are provided. I think that when the bike lines in place now in most places can trigger a lot of anxiety for people as they are being passed by cars and trucks going 30-45 mph, I know I am. I think that if we are going to make biking a popular mode of transportation we are going to need to redesign bike paths.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you say about the bike infrastructure part. Coming to UCSB I have biked way more than I would back home only because there are designated bike lanes around campus and even to my dorm. I would have never biked to get around back home because I feel completely unsafe if I were to get on the road with my bike. The only thing blocking me from traffic back is the white line on the road and many drivers still drive into it even though it is designated for bikers. Copenhagan seems like a great example of what to do in order to encourage people to use their bike to at least get to some of their destinations. I would feel a lot safer on my bike. Also we do need to do our research about who we vote for because it mostly affects our future and our generation.
<br><hr>
I'm glad you mention in this comment the so called "traffic jams" that happen with bike paths. I feel like some people would use that as an excuse for denying a good bike infrastructure, claiming that once more people switch to bikes, you'll get more "traffic jams" like that, and then it won't be any better than a traffic jam in a car. The thing is, though, that even the worst of the bike traffic is only slowing down a bit or maybe stopping when you're waiting to turn. In cars, you can be stuck in traffic for hours, moving barely more than a few inches while waiting just to go forward. That isn't even possible with bikes and bike paths. Really, traffic with bikes will beat traffic in cars in almost every instance.
<br><br>


I also really like your points about researching your local candidates and being in depth about it. Local action is extremely important, as Ken mentioned in this video, but a lot of local candidates will use marketing tricks to confuse voters or have people voting a candidate they wouldn't actually support if they knew the full truth about them. It's necessary to do research and make sure your vote counts and makes a difference for what you want rather than what you have been tricked into believing.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. The entire bicycle culture in the United States is underfunded, underappreciated, and despised, but I don't understand why. The bike industry is better for the environment and has less traffic. What's not to like? My stepfather cycles to work every day (and still wears a helmet), but I still worry about what will happen to him on his way to work because there are no good bike lanes. This leads to the political part of the climate crisis, because we all need to vote for someone who makes bike lanes a necessity. After watching this lecture, I also want to sell my car and ride a bike. However, putting your life in the hands of reckless drivers on the highway is scary. I think one day, with better bike lanes, more people will turn to cycling to help save the planet!
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your viewpoint after watching this vide. I believe that as a student at UCSB, I am contributing to being more environmentally conscious by opting to ride by bike everywhere instead of taking my car. At the previous university I attended, everything was all within driving distance. There was no way of biking to one destination to another because of how far apart everything was. However, upon attending UCSB, I was pleasantly surprised to see just how bike dominant our community was. There are so many bike lanes everywhere, making everything super accessible to reach on bike. In addition, I really like how our school is practicing being environmentally healthy by doing so. 
<br><br>
The statement that Ken mentioned of how cycling can create a big impact on changing our climate for the better really resonated with me because it really shows how just by everyone taking small measures like this, we are all able to work towards climate activism. It makes me proud to say that I too have been able to contribute to this just by taking small steps such as biking and opting for a more plant based diet and it it exciting to see just how much more of an impact I can make by taking even larger measures.
<br><hr>
Like you mentioned it is essential for everyone to vote for representatives that are willing to make a change in the world who will be able to start major changes that will lower our fossil fuel emission rapidly. For this 2020 election, we need to encourage as many people as we can to go out to the polls and vote if they want change to happen. But like you mentioned we should study and do our own research on candidates to obtain actual information from credible sources instead of just basing our ideas from what we have heard from peers or other people. Electing a president that supports the plan listed in the green new deal will help our entire society. It will be our first step into initiating big change but in the meantime, we can also incorporate our own contributions to reduce our own carbon footprint that will make a big difference if a big group of people also make minor changes to their lifestyles. After watching this video it inspired me to invest in a bike and become a more frequent biker, but like professor, Ken mentioned our roads are just not suitable for everyone to be riding a bike. Even then many of the people who do ride bikes feel unsafe biking on the shoulder of a driver since it is extremely dangerous and unsafe especially when drivers are driving at speeds higher than 50mph. In cases like this is when our president should be building a safer bike lane where people can bike and not worry about feeling unsafe or worrying about not having a bike lane on their way to their destination. Having a policy where infrastructure is implemented to improve our bike lanes and built in more racks will be very beneficial for our environment. Many places like Copenhagen have already improved their bike lanes or have provided a lane for bikers separate from drivers. Having this motivates more people to start biking and it has been seen in places like Copenhagen that people have greatly reduced their driving amount and have switched to biking more regularly. I believe our world can also make this change with the right political system and the right amount of people who are willing to support the change and commit to driving less and biking more.
<br><hr>
I agree after watching Ken's video I would like to bike more places. Although I usually drive everywhere, I would like to bike more. Biking in the area I live though is much harder though than here in Santa Barbara. Where Im from the only that separates the bikers from cars is a white line. At least at UCSB there's a bike path that goes from my dorm to campus and is operated for the most part from cars. I admire Copenhagen for their advices in their bike lanes. Having their bike lanes completely separated from the roads makes bikers feel much more safe and the upgrades to the bike lanes encourages more people to bike. Biking is also much better for the environment as it lowers your carbon emission. Also there is bike traffic when you bike on campus.

<br><hr>
I also found it chilling that 4 cyclists have been killed. I ride my bike everywhere I can, but some places just seem too dangerous so I would rather walk. Copenhagen sounds amazing. Maybe someday I’ll also go to experience the bike paths they have there. We have similarly terrible “bike lanes” in my hometown (they don’t exist). If the infrastructure was there, I would definitely ride everywhere, but unfortunately it isn’t.

<br><hr>
I agree that this video has inspired us. I am a cyclist myself, so I know its convenience and environmental protection.It is worth noting that many people are not willing to give up the car because the traffic road is not very friendly to the bicycle. If we can build more dedicated roads and supporting facilities for the bicycle, I believe more people will participate in it.We need to support legislators who think that way and get the roads built.
<br><hr>
You brought up a topic that I often think about, which is knowledgable voting. I think a lot of people just vote for what is familiar to them or goes with their party views without considering what they are actually voting for. It is important to know what you are voting for, because every vote counts, and if you vote for a candidate without researching what they stand for, and they get elected, you may be very unhappy with how they serve you. The more knowledge you have going into voting, the more likely you are to be satisfied with how the government, both locally and on a lager scale, serve you. Voting for the candidate that affiliates with your party does not necessarily guarantee that they will govern to your liking. There are plenty of candidates that are under-qualified, and unfit to hold a government position (shoutout to the current administration). In these cases, I believe it is better to vote for someone who at least will maintain order, and make it so that future government leaders have something to work with.  It is usually much easier to fix a car than it is to completely rebuild it, which is what could happen if people do not vote responsibly.

This video did a good job at making me realize the true value behind my daily actions. What caught my attention was the fact that even if everyone on the planet went vegan, it would not be nearly enough to mitigate the climate crisis. Up until this point in the class all I have thought about changing was the way I eat and how much energy I use throughout the day. However, I know value my right to vote even more knowing that that simple action holds more power than anything else I can do. I always knew that our right to vote holds power, but now I appreciate it even more. It is crazy to think that taking one or two hours to vote can have a bigger impact on our planet's survival than completely changing the way we live our daily lives. As Ken mentioned many times already, it is important for us to share this knowledge with those around us in order to create action, even if it is at the local level. We must take Copenhagen by example and work together to act upon our knowledge. Yes, the climate crisis is a national issue, but our local actions can have global consequences since personal action, climate activism and political activism are all interconnected. As people like to say, we must be the change we want to see in the world, and this starts with checking ourselves and encouraging others to do the same.

I agree! It was pretty shocking that even if the entire planet went vegan it still would not be enough. Although that is a fact, I think it's still important to try and adopt aspects of the vegan lifestyle if one is able to comfortably because anything still helps. I also like how you mention voting becausse that really is so important and we are able to make so many big changes by using our right to vote. It all starts at the local level and implementing that change so people can see that it is possible!


<br><hr>
This video and this class in general have also changed my view on voting for the better. I used to get annoyed by the booths in the Arbor that call you over to register to vote, but now I really appreciate and support them for doing their best to make sure peoples voices are heard. I even registered when they came to our class! I think it is important that, while not everyone is interested in going into a political career, everyone should be at least enough interested in politics to make sure they are voting because it will affect you both nationally and locally. As you mentioned, Ken brought up the case of Copenhagen and how their votes made such a difference in their city. Copenhagen saves 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 from going into the atmosphere each year because 2/3 of people now commute to work by bike instead of car. Imagine if the same thing happened in a heavily polluted city like Los Angeles. If 2/3 of LA drivers switched to biking instead of driving to work, this would have dramatic effects for our climate! But this has to start with local and national policies that empower the decisions of communities, and that is where our votes come in.
<br><hr>
This video also made me realize that my daily actions are not enough. I am vegetarian, energy conscious, and use public transportation, but my political engagement is almost non existent. Granted, this is only the first few elections where I am legally allowed to vote, but I have been blind to the importance of voting and the power it has over the environment. I think this is a disastrous problem and is common among the general public. If every individual who chooses not to vote, comes together and votes, that large group of people would bring historic change. As much as I'd like to consider myself a climate activist, I can't because I don't know what that means exactly. But I do think climate activism is where the climate crisis' problems must be approached from. I agree with your statement that our local actions have global consequences. That's where the climate crisis began. Personal interest.

<br><hr>
Hi there thank you for sharing and I completely agree with your comment! Personal actions are surely important and we should carry them out during our daily lives, but ultimately the issue with the fossil fuel companies who are the major contributors to the carbon emission into the atmosphere due to the practice of hydraulic fracking needs to be addressed if we truly want to improve the conditions of the climate crisis. Voting is a crucial and privileged right for citizens yet many of us do not realize how important it is to get our votes out and make our voices heard by the government consequently. Like many other students in the comment section, I used to not be able to understand the purpose of voting and I deemed it as pointless because I thought that my single vote would not have made much of an impact on the society. However, this lecture video educated me on the significance of voting and made me realize that we should all vote because this is the primary and the most effective way of delivering our wishes and requests to our government officials. My AP Government class in high school was always emphasizing the importance of voting and political participation, and not until now that I took this course and saw the detrimental consequences of climate change did I really understand the purpose of political participation and voting. Believe it or not, as long as you are willing to make the effort to be the change you want to see the world through voting and participating in environmental activism movements, the changes that you desire will eventually arrive.
<br><hr>
Talking about daily actions, I have always thought of biking as more of an inconvenience when going outside of school due to the intense work out that I have to put in. But as Professor Hiltner talked about this hybrid bike, I would actually like to give biking a try. It does sound very convenient and fun to bike downtown or somewhere further. Not only can I enjoy the views but also get a good amount of exercise. Also, I fully understand the bike road conditions around Santa Barbara. Even in our school, there are deadly bumps and cracks on the bike lane where I have fell several times, not to say the danger of going downtown. It is truly amazing how Denmark has successful promoted its biking campaign and it is even shocking to hear that 2/3 of the population travel on bikes. Personally, as a meat lover, it would hurt myself a lot to give up meat consumption. But I am aware that if I don’t “hurt” myself a bit, the entire planet and the people living on it would be hurt my me. Professor Hiltner’s video surely brings hope to not just students but also everyone who wants to make a change to the world and save the planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you have to say. I’m certainly thinking more about my daily actions that can be detrimental to the environment. I’ve certainly always had some sort of consciousness of what I do to a certain degree, but like you, this video really made me think about it more. Personally, I always take the time to vote on voting days in an attempt to make a change, but this video made me realize the importance in sharing the knowledge with those around us, like you said. I really like the way that you phrased that our small everyday actions can have a much larger impact on the world. I never really thought about it on such a large scale.

<br><hr>
I always knew that voting is one of the single most important duties as an American. Voting is our civil duty, and this video put it in a new perspective. Change doesn’t always happen at the federal level; it can start locally and spread if a policy seems to work in one city. I think it is really awesome that UCSB holds such a high regard for registering students to vote. So many young adults simply don’t show up to polling stations, but teaching young people that voting holds such a high importance in this country is a great way to spread awareness and get more people to vote for the rest of their lives.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you! So far in this class I thought that if everyone on Earth went vegan, our carbon emissions would become sustainable. I don't know where I got this idea, but it felt right especially with how much emphasis we've put on food. Also, like you said, I can't believe how important voting is in comparison to changing our daily lives. Honestly, I wasn't sure if I was going to participate in any votes besides the main presidential election, but now I can see that voting in all of them can have a big impact on our planet. I now will start looking into how to get involved in state politics and perhaps even city politics. With city politics, we could help build infrastructure in SB for bikes, etc. This video really put everything in perspective for me and I realize I can't put too much weight on just changing my diet, even though that is a great thing to do.

<br><hr>
Yes, I agree. Changing daily action probably is the most practical way for people who want to protect the environment. Everybody knows to reduce the CO2 emission is necessary. However, the significance of reducing CO2 emission is too less for most people. A better lifestyle and more comfortable life process means a lot to most people. Thus, it is impossible to let people give up something means a lot to exchange something means little. 

<br><br>

To vote for the person who has the will to solve the environmental issue is not a good idea. Most politician can not realize their plan. It is not to say they are liers. Sometimes the politician needs to compromise for the benefit of the most. Even the elected politician incline all his resources to protect the environment. It possible to cause the decline of the economy which is short-term pain. However, for the voter and citizen, it is not. People are short-vision, this may cause more negative influence among the people.


<br><hr>
Thanks for sharing and I agree with you! I am glad you share the astonishing point that even everyone switch to the vegan diet, it's still not enough to solve the problem we are facing. Most people think the minimal change they implement in their life can be aggregated to make a big change while Ken states that it's not enough. More and bigger changes must be made to solve the problem under the global scale. Being serious towards the voting is a good way to show how the public is thinking towards the problem. People should really fully use their power as a citizen to help reshape the society and the way it functions.
<br><hr>
I was also surprised that universal veganism in the world would not tackle the climate crisis. However, it is the everyday eco-conscious decisions that I make that remind me of the state of our planet and my constant dedication to protect it. When people find out that I am vegan they typically ask me various questions about the reason why I chose to cut animal products out of my life, which happens to be for environmental reasons. This instantly prompts environmentalist discourse, which then enables it to be more prevalent with my peers and other generations. From their responses, I often find they begin to question their choice in diet in terms of their carbon footprint. Therefore, the vegan community’s personal actions raises awareness of the need to be looking for solutions to combat climate change in daily life. It then becomes a chain effect just how you mentioned those in Copenhagen largely pushed legislation to adopt bike-friendly policies beginning with climate activists, to local politics and finally adapted in city-wide politics. Thus our personal actions are linked to activism which can revolutionize politics and institute impactful change.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment! Before I watched the video of the lecture for this week, I held the opinion that our personal action is not enough to change the whole world. However, after watching this video, I clearly realized that in most situations. Indeed, our individual actions can not influence the entire world, for example, even if we become vegetarian and give up eating meat, the amount of carbon dioxide we decline to emit is so small. Compared to this, the voting right, a thing that seems to have no influence on the problem of climate change, will definitely affect. Since now, I clearly realize the importance of the voting right, not only decide who will become the next president, but also will decide how the world will be changed. It may be the only chance that we can determine our future and influence and solve the problem of climate change. 
<br><br>



Also, I must admit that to force me to become a vegetarian is unreliable. I believe that a considerable amount of people will refuse to become vegetarian just because eating meat will cause global warming. And we all know that changing our eating habits is not enough to solve the problem. We should find more powerful and influential solutions to address it. From my perspective, to use the voting right to decide the future world seems more reliable and can be accepted. I believe that combining politics and the global warming issue is an excellent way to solve this problem fundamentally.

I agree that voting is important in order to get things done. While personal choices are important, legislation is much more effective in fighting climate change. We can vote for laws that ban fracking or ban fossil fuels, for example. It is good for the environment to be vegan but if lots of companies continue to burn fossil fuels then climate change won't stop. Legislation can be passed to make more and safer bike lanes that encourage biking rather than driving. I feel like personal action and political activism work together well. For example, if you like biking, then you will be inclined to vote for things that support biking. If you care about the environment, then you will support laws against climate change. Like you said, voting is a simple but very important action. If we vote for something like the Green New Deal, then it would be much easier to fight climate change.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. This video shows me how big of a impact voting can have compared to having a vegan diet and saving energy in our daily life. Voting for the ones with the environmentally friendly policies have such a big impact that we should use the power of voting as a important way of protecting our planet. I don't have the right to vote in the US, but as Ken said, we should share our knowledge on the subject and encourage those around us to vote for the right policies.
<br><hr>
I agree. I believe now this is a good time to wrap up a little bit of what we had talked about at this point of the quarter and compare and contract what we each can do to help mitigate the Climate Crisis. Personal actions are essential since the power comes in when groups of people devote changes into their daily lives. As for me, I decided to decrease my meat consumption and have a meat-free day after I’ve seen documentaries of how beef and other animal-product industries play a massive role in contributing to climate change. I am also glad that some of my other friends are in it together for the same cause. However, as Ken said “is it enough?” The fact that  Climate Change would still not be stopped even if everyone on this planet goes Vegan is quite a bit haunting, as meanwhile quite a substantial amount of people of this planet would not voluntarily do so. Therefore I believe we need to put good use into our democratic rights and cast our votes on politicians that would really save the planet. Voting in a sense is just like practicing Vegetarianism or Veganism. Individual actions in the eyes of an individual would not seem to make much of a difference, but when it’s taken collectively, our actions / casts would make a differences .
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed watching this week's lecture. Something that surprised me too was the vegan situation. I initially thought that if everyone went vegan it would have a very significant impact on the well-being of our planet. I thought that this was the case, specially since Ken has mentioned in class and many of his lectures that going vegan has a significant impact on someone's carbon footprint. Something that I did know made a big difference was using bikes. I feel that, specially here at UCSB everyone's carbon footprint is slightly smaller than the average American because of how big bike culture is here. Practically everyone here owns a bike and uses it to get from place to place. Most people that I know, specially other first years don't even have a car here and when they want to get somewhere they can't biking they use the public transport system. I feel like UCSB is doing a good job compared to other places in the US in the carbon footprint that we are leaving.

<br><hr>
This statistic caught my attention too. One of the major problems I have with the climate crisis is that in order for it to be suppressed, everyone must contribute on an individual basis to reduce emissions (which is not possible, not everyone will be willing to). It's, unfortunately, discouraging to learn that even if the entire beef industry was eliminated, it still would not be enough to placate the consequences of global warming. This is why I believe that acting on an individual basis is not the best way to reduce our carbon emissions. Acting individually makes it difficult for people to act because they only have their morals as a backbone. In groups and collectives, there is an entire community. As social creatures,  I believe we need people to undergo changes with us in order to feel motivated to apply permanent changes to our lifestyles. With a community, more voices are heard so more people will be inclined to join the movement. On their own, most people are too accustomed to their traditional lifestyles to give it up for a cause that has not directly affected them yet.
<br><br>


Like you mentioned, the only way we can start making a change in the world is by collectively applying those changes to ourselves and inviting more people to do the same. By creating a community of people that want to make a change in the world, we can create a cause behind why the climate crisis must be averted which people will be more inclined to join.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with your comment. During the duration of this course, I have realized that there are plenty of things that individuals can do to limit their carbon footprint and live more sustainably, however, if those same individuals do not vote in order to enact local and national policy to mitigate climate change, those individual life choices won’t be as important or significant. I already live my life trying to be as “green” as I can be, but I know that my vote is the most important thing I can do. While voting for who will be the next president is usually what everyone talks about, voting for local politicians is also equally important, especially since that vote will most likely have a stronger immediate impact. For example, voting for Joan Hartmann for county supervisor will have positive impacts on the environment right here as she wants to work to make our energy 100% fossil-free and opposes offshore oil and Central Coast fracking. Hartmann’s opposition for county supervisor, Bruce Porter, a Conservative businessman, is being backed by oil companies who want him to increase oil development and extraction. Depending on who wins the election, the Santa Barabara will either move in the right direction towards reducing emissions, or we will make the situation worse by extracting and burning more fossil fuels. This will be the first time I can vote, and I will make sure to support people who are prioritizing the betterment of the environment.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment! Oftentimes I find myself getting caught up in how I personally attribute to the climate crisis and that can be a bit of a hard concept to think about since generally the American lifestyle encourages the emissions of CO2 through our daily practices. Considering this I try to reduce my impact on the climate by eating less meats, buying less clothes, biking more, and putting in general more effort to be conscious about my personal carbon emissions. On another note, I've always known how important it is to be an active voter, however I was unaware that political participation is one of the biggest things we can do to change the current climate progression. However after Ken pointed it out it makes sense that political participation has such a large impact since as a democracy we  have the power to control legislation. If we could all unify to outlaw fracking then that would have such an immense impact on our carbon emissions and in turn could be the start towards becoming a carbon neutral country. In terms of Denmark, I believe they are setting a great example for other countries to follow. Access to safe and reliable biking would be a great incentive to encourage people to bike instead of drive across the city which in turn would also have an immense impact on the carbon emissions.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. This video totally changed my perspective on the way I view voting. I already knew how important it is to vote but after watching Ken’s video it also made me value it a lot more. This video made me reflect on my own actions and it surprised me to learn that even if we are vegan it still won’t be enough. We as individuals could do our best to change our daily habits to help our environment but it won’t make as big of an impact unless we take political action. Being able to bring awareness to other people and gain them to vote will also help make a difference. It is important to take political action rather than sitting back and waiting for change to happen. Policies could be made that can play a huge role in saving the planet. Voting can have such a huge impact which is why we should encourage our friends to do some research and vote.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. I was really surprised when I knew that the impact of personal behavior on the environment and climate was so small. For a while, I've been trying to turn myself into an environmentally friendly person. I didn't buy new clothes, walked to many places and ate more vegetables. I'm frustrated to learn that even a lot of people act like me, we still can't change a bad situation much. But on the good side, I now know that I can do something better to change this issue, which is voting and activism. I can stop wasting my limited time on unimportant things. I'm glad Ken's video made me understand that. Although I can't vote, I will do my best to spread the idea and get more people to vote for politicians who are willing to deal with climate issue. There is not much time left for us. We'd better start with ourselves and act immediately.

<br><hr>
I 100% agree. Throughout the course, meat production, agricultural industry, and food consumption (waste) have been some of the leading contributing issues to the growing and expanding climate crisis. Hearing that a transfer of 7.75 billion people to veganism would not suffice as a major implication for emissions and the environmental crisis at hand, was an absolute doozy. The problem with our diet and meat consumption is without a doubt a cultural issue directly linked with the mass-consumer culture that has permeated throughout all walks of life. As awareness of meat, dieting, and food consumption is becoming more popular in common culture today, I agree that is of utmost importance for our younger and growing generations to recognize the value of our vote and political potential as the primary influence and director of where our nation (and society) goes in the near future. What I highlighted, and what was most compelling within your comment was: "the climate crisis is a national issue, but our local actions can have global consequences since personal action, climate activism and political activism are all interconnected". This couldn't be phrased better. We cannot be too quick to judge others if we cannot implement this change within ourselves.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. If we only act as individuals, such as reducing our carbon footprint or eating less meat, it probably won’t help a lot to save our planet. We have to work together and make our voice get heard by the nation to make it realize how severe the problem is. We need to make every single person be aware of the crisis, which means educating people about this is very vital. Once the issue became politically, it would draw way more attention than just a group of people doing propaganda every day. We have to admit that we as an individual citizen are not influential enough to figure out an efficient plan to deal with our current issue. However, we definitely need to be carefully avoiding some politicians using the environmental crisis as a tool to win elections or benefiting themselves. Hence, we need officials who really care about the issues and are doing something.

<br><hr>
It really is crazy being of voting age and now having the ability to impact the world in a more meaningful way. While personal action is great and, if conducted on mass scale, can be very impactful, our actions matter most in the polls. As normal civilians, we have so much less power than those who hold office or have fortunes to contribute to climate relief. In this way we most certainly have the most effect on the environment. I really liked your quote at the end but sometimes we don't have the resources to spark the change we want to see in the world but the closest we can get to this is to VOTE for individuals that will be the change we want to see in the world. It is difficult sometimes, however, because our vote can seem so insignificant when counted alongside millions of other votes. We can give our vote more power though by putting action behind it. You may have voted, and that's great, but what if the person you voted for doesn't get elected? That's when we must look towards activism because politicians can't just ignore the other half of America that didn't vote for them. So I think all the things Ken addresses are all very important but most of all, I agree, is voting. And if that doesn't work, become more politically active and, eventually, your voice will be heard.

<br><hr>
It's really unfortunate and sad to me that even if we all as individuals changed our lifestyles, like going vegan, it would not have a significant impact on mitigating the climate crisis. But honestly, this fact didn't surprise me. It seems clear to me that the way to make meaningful change in regards to climate change is through policy and structural and economic large-scale change. And the way we can contribute is through voting and participating in our democracy, as well as sharing knowledge. However, I still admire people who are making changes in their individual life, as it takes commitment and dedication, and it's a way of spreading information and making certain lifestyle changes more "mainstream", which is helpful.

<br><hr>
I have to say that this video also did a good job at making me realize the true value behind my daily actions, and also, contrary to this comment, I did not really realize how much power my vote held. I know that every year there are people going around and standing in the Arbor making sure that everyone is registered to vote. I always kinda get annoyed, I am not going to lie, but now I realize how important it actually is to vote and how powerful it can be. I now understand why the people that care so much do care so much. I really thought that making little personal changes was the biggest thing that I could do on my own, and I never took voting seriously because I figured that my one vote didn’t matter compared to everyone else’s, but now I realize that it is more important that I vote more than anything else that I do.
<br><hr>
Voting is such an important thing to do. I was genuinely glad Ken mentioned how this can be an easy thing to do in order to make a positive impact on the environment in your personal life. I remember how frustrated I was at the last presidential election when I was 17 and unable to vote. To see things things be so out of your control was the worst feeling. It did, however, make sure to vote for the upcoming elections and the previous midterms. I also spend time looking into each of the candidates in order to see who I believe best represents the environment and social needs. I also thought Ken's take on bicycles was intriguing. As someone who doesn't own a car and commutes through biking, it can get taxing at times, and I so agree that bike paths are often times dangerous but it is an interesting idea that having most people ride bikes can significantly impact carbon emissions.
<br><hr>
I had the same reaction after watching this video. Since I understand the importance of all three I am less likely to feel like i'm not making a positive change in the climate crisis. I agree with you about now appreciating the right to vote now because of the major value it has on the remaining choices on the climate for this planet. Now that I live in Santa Barbara and go to UCSB, I have truly experienced the biking world and in my opinion I love it. I am from a very small town where the closest grocery store and school is about 45 minutes away and that is without traffic and large hills separating the two towns. Thus, I have never been able to truly transport from one place to the other by bike. Now that I have lived in Santa Barbara I can see how that the bike lanes are not safely made nor are they easy to navigate and this is the issue. No one is willing to bike around everywhere because it is so unsafe and difficult. I hope to one day visit Copenhagen so that I can see what the biking life is capable of because as of right now I do not see anyone switching to bike as the main transportation if there is not a change in how the bike lanes are constructed here. I believe that if we preform all three aspects: personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active we will be able to make a major positive change in our climate. If Copenhagen did it, then so can we but we will need to implement activism and personal action to lead by example to ultimately make a greater change.

<br><hr>
I was also surprised to hear that even if everyone on the planet went vegan, it would not have a huge impact on the climate crisis. This made me realize that it is important to become active in as many areas as you can. It would be a better idea when it comes to contributing to climate change. Personally, I am not eligible to vote, so I put more focus on changing my lifestyle entirely, not just my diet, but also on transportation and consumption as a whole. I am not a very outgoing person, so I focus more on encouraging people around me, like family and friends.
<br><hr>
I strongly agree with your opinion and the argument about the balance and interaction between personal action, activism, and political power. I also agree with your notion that we should take Copenhagen as an example and work together to learn from them and act upon our knowledge. I also find your conclusion very encouraging, as if we want to make a difference in the world, we should be that difference or change first and them encourage and impact the others to promote the change of a bigger impact. 
 <br><br>

In addition to your opinion, I also found Ken’s use of data effective and convincing in communicating the importance and interconnectedness of personal actions, activism, and politics. As Ken explained, 28% of methane emissions comes from meat (generally beef) production; however, an even greater amount comes from fossil fuel extraction, principally from hydraulic fracturing. This objectively reveals that personal actions have limited influence, and the role of activism and politics seem to be more powerful in the case of reducing fracking. Moreover, as I mentioned above, the example of Copenhagen is not only instructive but also encouraging; this real-life example can inspire other countries to learn and change. I like the use of such encouraging and realistic examples, which can give people more hope and also a practical pathway to follow. Additionally, I also like how Ken uses a variety of real-life examples such as his own e-bike example, the documentary Dear Governor Brown, and the teenager activist Greta Thunberg, which vividly illustrate how a lot of people, using different approaches, to address the climate change we are facing. Such illustration allows me to think what ways I can use to most effectively address the problem and how should I use those different approaches. I think this is a helpful and instructive lecture.

Just to preface this comment, it is a total claim that you haven't experienced a traffic jam on your bike: just try getting from IV theater to the library at 10am on a Tuesday and you will understand. The bike paths of UCSB spare no one. 
  <br><br>

This video really gets at the heart of the coherence between personal action and governmental action necessary  in order to mitigate the climate crisis. It would not be enough to simply have the government act to mitigate the climate crisis in the same sense that it would not be enough for everyone to go vegan and get really good at riding their bikes. But it might be the wrong way of framing the issue of the climate crisis: that making personal changes and invoking change in our government are really a big difference. If people were to make the same choices as my boy Ken and bike from downtown SB to UCSB every single day, then sure enough people would die in horrible bike accidents that the government would build better bike lanes, but people's conception of the risk and reward of riding a bike has just as much to with people being worried that they will look like total nerds riding a bike then it does with personal risk. A better solution would be for people to start to view individual actions in coherence with government actions: people need to start riding bikes to work more AND start to advocate for better infrastructure for those bikes through voting and advocacy. If the government then builds better bike lanes, and less people die, then maybe people will wake up and realize that biking to work is cool, safe, and good for the environment. 
 <br><br>
 If this answer sounds convoluted, it is because it is.  It is inherently a VERY convoluted problem: at the intersection of government action, personal action, and social pressure is the solution to climate change. Finding a way to satisfy all parties is not possible: but it is a lot easier for someone to look like a nerd then for someone to lose their house to rising oceans.

I think your point about the solution to climate change being at the intersection of government action, personal action, and social change touches on the overarching goals of this class. I agree that individual actions need to go hand-in-hand with systemic changes in order for impacts to be effective. The government holds the structural power to make greener options available and efficient, such as better public transportation systems and safer bike paths. At the same time, the people hold power from below to demand these improvements. By creating more environmentally-conscious opportunities that people want, I think the “coolness” factor will follow. I also agree that we as individuals have power in who we vote into government positions. Therefore, not only is it important for us to vote, but also to do our research before making a decision. It is the citizen’s responsibility to choose who we want to advocate our needs for us.
<br><hr>



I couldn't agree more with your comment! It is unfortunately a sad reality that in this generation, we have not yet left behind the nervousness and anxiety of being an “outcast” or being looked at differently for our personal decisions. While I personally would never hesitate at biking everywhere, it is no secret, as you said that the thought of being viewed as a “nerd” for riding your bike everywhere holds a certain sway over the decisions people make. As you so eloquently ended your comment, the truth of the truth of the matter is that this issue or rather crisis we’re dealing with right now does not have simply one solution because it’s much more complex than that. It won’t take one way or the other to fix the climate crisis and attempt to rebuke it’s advances but rather a mix of people making personal decisions for themselves and being more involved in political activism to inform themselves and others to save this planet. At the end of the day, people will have to get over themselves and realize that we don’t have many more options to mull over before millions of people around the globe begin to suffer the effects of this climate crisis.


<br><hr>
I agree with your idea! It is the intersection between personal action and political action that can actually change the climate crisis in a positive way. Any single factor is not effective enough to bring a big influence on this issue. Government is the most powerful force to advocate for protecting the earth and also it is the one who is able to provide construction change and facilities to benefit people who choose to live in a green style. People are the ones who have their own willingness to decide whether to live environmentally or not. And their choice can affect their daily life and some important choices, such as voting. If they decide to live in a green way, when they vote, they would like to choose those politicians who are environmentalist. So they also are affecting the politicians. It is like a circle. People and politicians are influencing each other. Only both of them take action to solve the climate crisis, we are able to move forward a step in solving this issue.

I feel like this week's readings, films, and youtube videos' main focus was on trying to get everyone to vote in the elections. In Ken's video, he emphasizes the importance of not only state, but local elections as well. Hearing Naomi Klein's quote at the beginning of the video was kind of sad because of how true it is. I sometimes truly believe that humans have gone way too far and there may be no way for our planet to come back from all the damage it's taken already. Although many people have tried making small changes, like switching out their types of lightbulbs within their households and switching their diets, it isn't enough to see noticeable changes across the planet. Seeing that 2/3 of global gas emissions comes from energy and transportation fossil fuels is pretty crazy. I personally don't have my own car so biking and taking public transportation is my only mode of getting around out here in Santa Barbara. If more individuals chose to go this route as well, I believe gas emissions would slowly start to decrease and that would be one of the first indications that there may be hope for our planet.
<br><br>
It is extremely hard to see any progress with older generations still here. They have grown accustomed to their ways which then makes it harder for us to convince them to make these changes in their lives voluntarily. Older generations also play a part in why we aren't able to elect the right politicians. Newer generations are definitely voting for politicians who are trying to make a change but we are being held back by those considered "boomers." I hope to see my generation taking this election seriously so our votes outnumber older generation's. If you have the privilege to vote, take advantage of it.

There is real value behind my daily actions, and it is important to remember that every little action matters. We need to have that type of mindset if we’re going to create change and survive. We no longer have the luxury of slowly adapting to a renewable lifestyle. There has to be a huge culture change. The idea of this makes me extremely cynical that we will survive the climate crisis. I value all my freedoms and appreciate how blessed I am but I don’t see another way out other than government intervention. We need to back up our climate activism with political action. The spread of reliable information so that people make educated votes is key.

When I was in middle school, I biked to school everyday for 3 years. On the way, I see my friends and we talk to each other for a good 10 minutes. And because of the crazy traffic, I also see my classmates who anxiously sit in the car and worry about being late for school. With police officers guide traffic, biking is safe everyday, and those biking days became one of my best memories. However, as I grow up, I feel I’m lazy because I don’t ride bicycles anymore, and with more and more cars on the road, biking is no longer that safe, especially when there is no police officer guiding traffic. Considering more cars lead to fewer bikes, and cars contribute more greenhouse gas emission, I think it’s important for the government to offer their people more access to bikes to build safer bike lanes. Denmark has proven that building a bike-inclined society is feasible and efficient and has set a good example for all of other countries, so let’s make bike-commuting a norm of our lives.

When watching this lecture, I really enjoyed Ken's anecdote of Copenhagen's successful shift from transportation by cars to bikes, because I feel that it was a great example of how we can use our own actions and activism to eventually create political change that benefits the climate. In Copenhagen, this manifested itself first as more people taking action and biking to conserve oil reserves, followed by the activism of groups such as the Danish Cyclists Federation and Operation White Crosses to increase the viability and support for biking, and finally in the government taking steps to create more cycle tracks and making a coordinated effort to increase biking throughout the city. 

<br><br>

In my opinion, these three steps, going from action to activism to political change,  are very repeatable, and thus I believe that they provide a blueprint for how best to change any other environmentally-destructive habits that we have. As Ken noted, personal action certainly must come first, because when you make something a personal habit, such as not eating meat or forgoing a car, it is much easier to advocate for these things as an activist or voter. Activism must come next,  because in my opinion this is the most likely way in which we can convince politicians that an issue is important to a large number of people. Once enough people begin to advocate for the change of some environmentally-destructive habit, many politicians looking for their votes or support will undoubtedly act, and that is when big changes can be made. While it would be ideal if politicians simply saw the environmental issues facing us and acted without the personal action and activism of their constituents, in our current system I believe that major political change will likely only happen if it is preceded by action and activism.

I also found the example of Copenhagen inspirational. Some things people think are impossible simply haven't been done before. Copenhagen proves that this kind of change on a grand scale is possible. I think Santa Barbara would be an ideal place to initiate this shift to include bicycle paths rather than just lanes on the shoulder. We already have bike paths throughout campus at UCSB, and one on El Colegio which makes it safer for upwards of a thousand students who live in the Santa Catalina dorms to get to school. I would love for Isla Vista and even Goleta to build bike paths for the ease of getting around town without endangering my life on streets busy with drivers fresh out of high school. We need more people involved with non-profits like the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition, which has put millions of dollars toward bicycle infrastructure around Santa Barbara. Even more critically, we need people to vote. This is the way to instigate change on the same scale as Copenhagen.


<br><hr>
I agree with you, Copenhagen was a great example of what can be done. The fact that locals literally impacted so much just by voting really shows us that this same thing can happen if we take actions. What I found really interesting was the point that Copenhagen has had 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 reductions by switching to bikes. The Operation White Crosses to me was such an amazing idea, it literally makes people become more conscious of why they should be supporting more and taking action. Copenhagen really is a great example of what could happen here, if our government were like theirs we could potentially also have increased biking throughout the city. I too believe personal actions would be the first step towards change. I agree with what you’re saying, how can you advocate for something yourself do not do. Taking personal actions would make it easier to advocate for what you support. Politicians to gain votes would go with what a lot of people support, they would eventually get on board if enough people are advocating for the same things. The step after this would be voting like Copenhagen did, this would hopefully lead to the change just like they had. Ken’s reminder that knowledge becomes power was really great. Taking action about something you’re passionate about makes you powerful.
<br><hr>
I really agree with the three steps from action to activism to political change you mentioned. Not only do these steps occur in turn, but they catalyzes the occurrence of the next, too, and eventually become a benign cycle. 

<br><br>

Personal actions are the first step, but they need to be encouraged as well. The effectiveness of personal actions, such as ditching your car and turn to alternative transportation like riding a bike, requires the support of government. Just as the example of Copenhagen’s bicycle infrastructure and policies Ken mentioned in the lecture, it is these government decisions that further motivates individuals to switch from automobiles to cycling. 
<br><br>


If there is no bike lane at all, or if people are even dying due to the danger caused by bike-lane-less roads and the horrifying traffic rushing through you at the speed of 50 miles, then how is it possible for more people to changing their transportation and join the group of dangerously pedaling in street without protection. It is nearly impossible to encourage more personal actions without government making changes first. This is where activists enter the stage because this special group of people act like a glue and a bridge between individuals and the government. Activists evolve from individuals who are passionate enough to continue call for changes at a higher level, so if there are no personal actions first, there will be no activists. Therefore I think the presence of climate activists are very crucial and essential because not only their actions may change the political system and really pass on the authority to those who care, but moreover the consequential changes will provide better opportunities for individuals and thus encourage them to act. We should encourage more individual actions since this is the easiest way to bring people together and into the climate crisis topic, so that the rest of the cycle can be continued and expanded.

<br><hr>
I agree with your statement that our personal actions and activism will create political change that will benefit our climate and our nation as a whole. The process starts off small, but it builds up over time from local, to state, to eventually governmental. For example, in Copenhagen once more people started taking action and biking to conserve oil reserves, politicians took notice of that, which in turn led to the government taking their own action into helping the people fight for what they believe is the best for the environment. These are the types of things that need to happen in the United States now and quickly, not later and slowly, but now. 
 <br><br>
I agree with your claim that, “...going from action to activism to political change, are very repeatable…”, and might I add very important. It’s a nice, gradual plan that seems like it would make a smooth transition to cause societal and political change for the better. You’re completely right on your activism claim that activism is the most likely way to convince politicians that this is a real problem, and this can be primarily addressed through activism strategies such as protests. Politicians see this and will then want to get the vote of this majority, so they’ll promise to implement what they want. This is where political change occurs and it’s all smooth sailing from there. We just have to hope that the government makes the right, logical decisions. It seems as if as long as we implement action and activism, then there should be a chance that we could actually have a shot at making a big difference in our world for the better.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in that we must take action and be activists in order for change to be implemented. Politicians want voters and if we rally together we can call attention to the necessary change that must occur in order for our earth to survive and thrive. In this case, we must call attention to the benefits and necessity of the Green New Deal. If politicians see that this has voter recognition and approval, there is a large chance that it can become policy and transform our systems. It is important to recognize the impact of our personal decisions but to also be aware of the power that rallying together to advocate has. 
 <br><br>

On the other hand, we must “walk the walk” to “talk the talk” in that we must make our daily decisions that reflect what we are advocating for. We must be examples of the ideologies that we want to be implemented into our systems. From our diet to our transportation decisions, we can take steps that will inspire others and transform the culture of our country.
<br><hr>
I agree that for a lot of issues and transitions such as transportation, the pattern of personal action to activism to political change seems to be a very actionable, concrete blueprint to enact real change on a large scale. What worries me, however, is once we must approach the truly difficult decisions that are not dealing with simply lifestyle changes and infrastructure changes. Can this model work when the livelihoods of thousands of families are what is at stake? Can we really depend on people to willingly quit their jobs in order to refuse supporting coal industries, falling into poverty and ruin, just so that they can turn to activism, while living off of virtually no living wage? I think, in the realm of difficult decisions concerning climate action, the blueprint of action must be reversed. When toppling whole economic industries and dealing with the livelihoods of thousands of American families, change must start with the government, because only the government has the power to ensure the safety and prosperity of such a large number of citizens at once.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. I think Ken did a great job in explaining how Copenhagen did a great job in transitioning to bikes from cars. I also agree that it is a great way for our generation to take action. I believe it is such an easy way for us to be more responsible with our carbon footprint. We don’t need to drive such short distances when we can bike to our destination. Biking will also get Americans more into shape which will help the obesity problem that is currently happening in America. I also believe it is a great opportunity for activists to start sprouting up around in the US supporting biking over driving. I think the most important part is making bike lanes safer in cities. In Copenhagen the bike lane is shielded by parked cars which ensures the pedestrians safety. For example in New York City there are city bikes everywhere but not a lot of people use them because the bike lane is in the middle of the street. This makes people uncomfortable to ride their bikes. I think this is one of the most important aspects for an activist group to fix, and if they do they will find way more people riding bikes.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. All three factors are equally important, but just acting on one of these factors without the others is not enough. Becoming vegan dramatically decreases your carbon footprint but without fighting for the rest of the world's carbon footprint, are you really doing anything? I mean of course you are doing ~something~, but it defeats the purpose if you aren't sharing with others because it's not just you in the world. So along with being cautious citizens for ourselves we have to do it for other people's sake as well--taking the time to politically educate yourselves through careful research, but also spreading the word through boots-on-the-ground activism. Uncomfortability and movement is how you get things done in this world, and we have seen numbers of examples from the Civil Rights Movement to Operation White Crosses and many more. But also works the other way around, you can't shout at people for shopping fast fashion but then buy your entire wardrobe at Forever 21 the next day. Although I feel like I am just repeating what Ken talks about in the entire video, you really do need all of these factors in order to change the way things work (but do not work).

<br><hr>
I really agree with the three steps from action to activism to political change you mentioned. Not only do these steps occur in turn, but they catalyzes the occurrence of the next, too, and eventually become a benign cycle. 

 <br><br>

Personal actions are the first step, but they need to be encouraged as well. The effectiveness of personal actions, such as ditching your car and turn to alternative transportation like riding a bike, requires the support of government. Just as the example of Copenhagen’s bicycle infrastructure and policies Ken mentioned in the lecture, it is these government decisions that further motivates individuals to switch from automobiles to cycling. 

 <br><br>

If there is no bike lane at all, or if people are even dying due to the danger caused by bike-lane-less roads and the horrifying traffic rushing through you at the speed of 50 miles, then how is it possible for more people to changing their transportation and join the group of dangerously pedaling in street without protection. It is nearly impossible to encourage more personal actions without government making changes first. This is where activists enter the stage because this special group of people act like a glue and a bridge between individuals and the government. Activists evolve from individuals who are passionate enough to continue call for changes at a higher level, so if there are no personal actions first, there will be no activists. Therefore I think the presence of climate activists are very crucial and essential because not only their actions may change the political system and really pass on the authority to those who care, but moreover the consequential changes will provide better opportunities for individuals and thus encourage them to act. We should encourage more individual actions since this is the easiest way to bring people together and into the climate crisis topic, so that the rest of the cycle can be continued and expanded.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you and the anecdote of Copenhagen also attracts me. Before watching Ken’s mini-lecture for this week, “Personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active. Which matters more”, I would say that personal action definitely outweighs the other two, in the aspect of executive capacity and the maximum likelihood of accumulatively making changes, because of the lack of knowledge on climate activism and political action and the blind confidence on our own actions. However, Ken’s mini-lecture totally refreshes my mind. Besides the impact of personal actions, there are multiple ways for each individual to make a difference. In the U.S., the biggest power that people have is the right to vote, which is the best opportunity to be engaged in political activities. As an international student, we couldn’t get to involve in that and our choices are limited. However, we still can make differences upon the choices that we have now. 

 <br><br>

I think Denmark is setting a good example for us all to follow and even imitate. The climate activism in Denmark is so big that nearly everyone in Denmark noticed the negative effects that their carbon footprints brought to their environment and they took advantage of their right to convince their government to make adjustments on the form of legislation. Now, the government vigorously promotes biking as the way of transportation, which leads to a huge reduction of carbon emissions on a national level. This success was such an inspirational example for the world to reflect on and make changes.


<br><hr>
I completely agree. Ken explaining the success of Copenhagen shows that it is possible to shift to a predominantly biking workforce, and that it is successful and should be emulated. This gave me hope. Knowing that we have a example to emulate will create an easier pathway for political change. It is true that we need to make a coordinated effort to promote and increase biking. If the people push the politicians who push other big wigs, change is inevitable. We just have to make sure this change happens soon, or the life of the planet is at stake. 
 <br><br>

Action to activism to political change paints the perfect mental image of how we can change the world. It is a good mindset to have, and acting on it will result in political change, which is highly necessary. We must shift away from these environmentally destructive habits we use of a daily basis. The burning of fossil fuels through car use and manufacturing is so easily avoidable if we all were to use bikes instead. People first take action and change their own behaviors. Then, they advocate for others to join their new lifestyle, and start a movement. After this, they lobby the politicians and enact political change. This is a plan that begins with the common folk, and not the political or social leaders. Unfortunately, the politician are not acting on their own to stop the climate crisis, so they must be pushed and lobbied. In our corrupt governmental system, politicians care more about the money they make and the companies that support them than the people they represent and the world they live in. This is the sad reality. It is in our own hands to begin to stop the climate crisis on a wide level, because it begins with action, then activism, then political change.
<br><hr>

I agree with your argument completely. The nature of personal action, climate activism, and political activism feed off of one another. The previous creates momentum in the one that follows and so on. With a personal realization in values and the need for change, one can make an effort in contributing to a group effort to combat the climate crisis. Through the power of numbers, this can bring great change in public policy and gain attention from those in power. The power lies within the people, as we repeatedly and continue to see that those in government fail to acknowledge the issue of climate change and rather use it as a political topic for favorism by the public. However, this can change. If the people choose to voice their concerns for the dying planet, policymakers will have no choice to acknowledge the climate crisis and propose changes in order to remain with public support. We have the power to constitute change and amend the destruction we have done to the planet. Through a united front such as climate activism, we can gain the foundation in order to reach ideas to lawmakers and those in power. This is the most effective use of the system instead of idly standing by and considering if we really can do anything to change the future of the planet.

<br><hr>
Hi, I also really liked Ken's example of Copenhagen's success or change to more of a bike-friendly environment. I also thought that the fact that they were able to get 62% of people to commute by bike was great. If the U.S. was able to get the same number of people to convert to using bikes it would save 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 emissions per year. I think that this is something we need to do but the conditions need to change in order for this to happen. Bike lanes are dangerous and often times non-existent where they are needed. This example brings in the idea of how we need to be activists in order to accomplish this. In addition, it also shows how being politically active is important. But in order to do both of these things, I think it is important to be able to practice what you preach. This means if you are fighting for an increase in bike commuting you have to be doing this yourself which is why personal action is also very important. I really like how you put it above that it is easier to advocate for something that you personally do.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you said and think that learning about the successful transformation from cars to bikes gives us hope that we can do the same too even though we may think it is impossible. Learning by example may be the best method for the US to shift into a more climate friendly place because without seeing it happen in other places we will never want to be the first ones to try something seemingly risky out. Before leaning more about the process of how we could transition, I was pretty skeptical myself that we could ever do it but now I see that it is very doable as long as we become determined and united as a whole in doing so. 
 <br><br>


Another important point that Ken mentioned was the importance of voting. Before I also didn't really think of how climate issues would arise in the voting system but in todays world it is very present and it needs to become more noticed so that politicians and government officials can communicate more strongly to the public the overwhelming need for people to actually act on these issues. These are the people that we look up to and it needs to come from them in order to get a majority of people to truly believe that these problems are real and serious. As I get older and more educated, I continue to gain awareness on the impact that my vote actually has and that it is so dire for everyone to come together and work to make a difference in any way we can. In order to create a united society, we all need to put our votes in and come to a mutual agreement to save our world.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your steps to helping improve the climate crisis. If we want to see drastic changes soon we need to become more politically involved like you said. Activism is a healthy and easy way to be involved and make a difference. This gives people an opportunity to speak their voice and try to make changes at a state or national level. Voting is also an easy way to be involved and it is important that we elect future officials concerned with the climate crisis. We need to start implementing programs nationwide, and especially within the school systems to help conserve and contribute to saving our climate crisis. I was surprised to learn that Copenhagen's activism resulted in a shift of main transportation modes. In Copenhagen, 2/3 of the people bike for transportation. They realized how much of a carbon footprint they were all leaving and wanted to change this. They were successful in doing so and this is the shift that the US needs to make as well. We need to make bike transportation more effecient and safe by creating more and bigger bike paths. We need to create a strong appeal to bikes and somehow incentive people to start riding instead of driving if we want to help our climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed Copenhagen's gradual "degrowth" of auto-transport, into bikes as well. It's like they took a step back to advance three steps forward technique, but like Ken is reminding us, this is a multilayered, leveled, and multi-step process. We cant compromise for even one thing. We must see this climate crisis in its entirety, or face it's wrath all the same. The same goes with the issues that are out of our reach, i.e via fracking, or those large corporations who won't give up releasing those damn greenhouse gasses. Although i personally agree with you that these actions are indeed, repeatable. But we need to act with all of us. And it definitely is easier once the gears are in motion. If we manage something, anything with traction, that is our opportunity to move forward. Like Ken's electric hybrid bike, peddling becomes easier once your in motion. I guess the first step would be getting our local politicians to acknowledge the public need for something like, better bike lanes, and eventually  lead it into something major like an increase in renewable energy systems.
<br><hr>
I also really liked the Copenhagen example because it shows how eco-friendly a city can be if it encouraged biking. I found it really inspiring that environmental and biking activists in Copenhagen were actually able to make a change and urge their government to create bike-friendly infrastructure and bike lanes. Here in America, I feel like our government is, for the most part, largely unresponsive to our climate strikes and activism. I do agree that the Copenhagen's activists provide a blueprint for us on how to successfully bring about environmentally friendly government actions. Their success provides a precedent that governments can enact changes for the environment if we push them hard enough for it.
<br><hr>
I agree with you and I also like the example of Copenhagen. It shows that it is totally doable to shift transportation to bikes, and climate activism works. The environmental activist in Copenhagen really did make a progress to force their government to build cyclist friendly infrastructure like bike lanes, and that is where being politically active is also important. We need to use our power to vote for politicians to issue legislation which would able to solve the problem of climate change, such as to stop fracking as mentioned in the video.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that Copenhagen is a good example of what can be done. Through the power of the government to build more bicycle lanes to make cyclists safer and more convenient, this can attract more people to ride bicycles and reduce the use of cars. The impact of a separate vote on the locals is indeed great, and it does show us that the same thing could happen if we act. In order to get votes, politicians will get the support of many, and if enough people support the same thing, they will eventually be selected. At present, citizens' attention has not been focused on environmental protection, which makes politicians rarely pay attention to environmental protection issues. Only when the education level of the entire population rises to a certain level will we be more concerned about the environment and the future. This may be easier to achieve in a certain region, but a lot of effort is needed nationwide.
<br><hr>
Ken’s Copenhagen anecdote was very inspiring to learn about. Like you commented, activism and voting for the right policies and people are super important because our vote can mean something and contribute to change. Biking and using public transportation as a primary source of transportation can certainly help in urban cities where greenhouse gases come from having cars. Implementing plans like biking and the use of public transportation can be used anywhere as well from urban cities like Los Angeles and rural towns. America needs to culturally change as well, the idea of having a car or more than one car per person for the aesthetic or because a person’s role model has more than one car needs to change. Biking everywhere or taking the bus to work should be culturally accepted by everyone to be properly implemented. Not just transportation but we should change our diets and adopt a “flexitarian” diet at least. Eating less beef and less demand for beef will cause the beef supply to decrease thus creating fewer methane emissions from cows. I agree with personal action being our priority and then activism. We can only consciously make these decisions knowing the effects it can have on the environment, no matter how “small” we think our actions may be. One small action in a community will and can blossom into activism which can influence our local or national government.

<br><hr>
I agree that personal activism is a helpful stepping stone to the more powerful avenue of political activism, but I also think that we too often are told in our society that the consumer is as fault for climate change. I think this is a dangerous trap to get stuck in, as even if we all tried to reject consumer culture/capitalist culture/waste culture/the meat industry/transportation emissions that are all around us, we wouldn't be able to stop climate change nearly as fast as we could if people in positions of power initiated change first. I firmly believe the system itself must change. We should never feel like recycling and going vegan means we are saving the planet, because while those are great choices to make, we need to target the big stuff at this late stage in the development of the climate crisis. That means taking down the big corporations causing the majority of the damage, helping low-income communities escape climate disaster, and re-working governmental systems as well as legislation to fight global warming. These things are accomplished though relentless political activism.
<br><hr>
I too enjoyed the anecdote of Copenhagen's mass shift from cars to bikes in daily commutes. In order to motivate people to do the same around the world, it is important to show successful examples such as the one in Copenhagen to show that it is actually feasible to do so. When people see these successful examples, it sort of bridges the mental gap between wanting to participate in a changing movement and actually doing so. I am a bit surprised that this Copenhagen example has not been used more prominently in election campaigns and etc to help convince people to move away from cars.

<br><hr>
I also appreciated Ken's example of Copenhagen's success in shifting the main method of transportation. It showed everyone that many similar areas can also make a shift from cars to bikes. While I think it's easier for a place like Copenhagen to make such a big change, it's still a small step towards a country like the US making such a change. The problem with cities in the US like Los Angeles is that they are super spread out. This makes the idea of bicycle transportation in the city much less realistic. To combat this, we need to focus on making new cities planned around non-car-focused transportation. It's pretty amazing how much change people can make together against issues like climate change. It's sad to hear that SB declined the construction of more biking infrastructure in favor for more car ramps. It's not too late for a place like SB to make a big shift towards bicycle transportation.
<br><hr>
I also really liked hearing about Copenhagen’s successful change from transportation by cars to bikes. Seeing evidence of how activism can create political change gives me hope that I can do something in my own town. While I do believe Santa Barbara, and especially UCSB, has better bike lanes and structures in place than most places, if we could create lanes that are protected from moving cars like in Copenhagen, that would be even safer and greater.  I also do think that the steps that go from action to activism to political change is a great blueprint for changing many negative environmental habits that we currently have. We must first take action and change our own habits before we can think about being activists of the issue. Then as activists, we can fight for political change. To help with political change, we really need to stress the importance of voting to everyone that we can reach. Voting is also much easier for most people than making personal habit changes. I believe that taking a mere one or two hours out of your time a year to vote is definitely something that everyone can achieve. Overall, we really need all three methods of personal action, climate activism, and political activism to bring on great change to the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I as well found the Copenhagen example very inspirational. Sometimes all it takes is for the right person to find the right sob or discovery to shock the world into belief. As a prime example in setting the standard for bike safety, I think that Santa Barbara would be more than the ideal place to start to push concepts similar to Copenhagen; across the United States, we lead the standard by having the bike paths that are seamless and that have the right of way over cars. By promoting the new system that would be in place, it would be easier for other places across the country to participate, or at least pick up some of the current systems of safety that we have in place. It would be fantastic to see how far Santa Barbara, Isla Vista, and Goleta could push the limit of bike safety to; for example, by adding more bike paths and access points to new locations would be ideal. But overall, we just need some more dang people to vote for politicians that are committed to change, where their vote is determined by people who are environmentally aware.
<br><hr>
I also found Hiltner’s example using Copenhagen really interesting. I liked how he described how each action, voting, and activism was used to achieve safer bike lanes from people to politicians. Prior to watching the video, I was never eager or even thought to participate in political activities. I was not even planning on voting because I did not really understand the importance. I felt like one person’s vote is not going to matter, especially in the presidential election and living in California. I also never took any personal action like avidly recycling, eating less meat, etc. Truthfully, I thought there was never going to be a change, and the only action that anybody could take to help create change was activism. However, as a full time struggling student, I don’t really have time to be Greta Thunberg. So when Hiltner emphasized that voting was something you can do to contribute if you don’t have a lot of time, I was more eager to vote to save the environment.
 <br><br>
You perfectly explain how personal action, voting, and activism is all integrally connected! Personal action is a lot easier than the other two, and it can be a daily reminder of the actions we have to take control of global warming. The next step is activism in which you basically convinced politicians to take upon this issue because so many people are advocating for it. Finally, when politicians act, whether in pleasing us or convincing us to revote for them, we act by voting for environmentally friendly policies and politicians!

After watching Ken’s video, I think it is the time for me to reconsider my transportation method. I live in old town Goleta, and I drive to school in only five minutes every business day, thanks to the CA-217. However, in many case, I decide to drive my cars several times in a single day on campus in order to get another class which may locate “far” away from where I was. For example, if I just finished my music class in Music building, I would take my car in parking lot #3 to go to my statistic class which locates in IV theater. On the other hand, in fact, I should just take a bike with me. You know, I should just attach a bike behind my car everyday, and then take it off when I arrive the school. That is going to be much more convenient and could reduce my carbon footprints as well. Another reason I think I should do this is that I always go to the gym to ride a bike. In other words, I find myself act contradictory. I will start to do this next week. I hope this is going to work.



</p><hr>



<p>
Thank you Ken. This is my favorite video so far. Personal action, climate activism, and political action are all crucial when tackling the climate crisis. With the presidential election underway, political action is an important and extremely effective strategy to combat the climate crisis. As Ken stated in the video if we want to end fracking we must vote to stop it. We are lucky enough to live in a democracy where our vote matters and is heard so we must take advantage of it. Voting for our planet is the easiest thing any beginning climate activist can do. 
 <br><br>

Something that I will never get over is the importance of alternate transportation. I believe that this has been the most important thing I have learned in this class. It makes me so proud to be at a school where riding your bike to and from class is the norm. While it is the norm there are still a staggering amount of cars in Isla Vista. Many people get in bike accidents with other bikers which you can’t control but riding through IV and almost getting hit by a car is terrifying. You would think that in our square mile where transportation is predominantly bikes that it would be safer to ride them.

Before watching this lecture video, I already had a pretty high opinion of Denmark. They are one of the countries that follows the ‘Nordic model’ which is a set of economic and social policies that the Nordic countries of northern Europe have in common. It’s characterized by strong labor unions, social programs, and strong regulation on capitalism. I am a big supporter of a lot of these policies and I admire the Nordic countries a lot. When Ken talked about Copenhagen and their environmentally friendly bike culture I was not surprised at all, and it only deepened my respect for Denmark. It was interesting to see the parallel between Copenhagen and the bicycle culture that we have here at UC Santa Barbara as well. I really think that the United States, as well as other countries, could really benefit a lot by taking inspiration from the Nordic countries such as Denmark! 
 <br><br>

In response to the title of the video, I don’t think that any of the three actions listed in the title matter significantly more than any of the other two. Personal action, climate activism, and being politically active are all important and effective tools in combating the climate crisis, and they can often overlap and affect each other as well! Especially since more and more of the world is becoming aware of the threat that climate change faces, climate activism is becoming an increasingly large part of regional, national, and international politics. 
 <br><br>

I’m thankful for this class since it has really educated me and truly expanded my knowledge and understanding of the very complex issue that is climate change. Thanks to what I have learned in this class so far, I can feel a little bit more inspired to take action and be environmentally conscious even in seemingly small ways!




</p><hr>



<p>
Thank you, Ken. It is so true that every little detail matters and I strongly agree with it and reflect it on myself. During my stay at UCSB, for a whole month I had to move away from dorm to an apartment farther away from campus, since my family was visiting me. I usually take the bus to school, since it’s actually convenient and fast, but I never thought farther about the environment saving part. Then when I moved to the apartment, I woke up at my usual time but it was too late always for that distance, so for not being late, I took the Uber for a month. However, I never thought that small action of mine was causing a lot more pollutions than me taking the bus with everyone. My feeling is both intellectual and emotional, but generally this urgent issue should be solved as soon as possible, since people did not even notice how serious the situation can be.




</p><hr>



<p>
Ken, I absolutely love that you mention Mark Ruffalo calling out California's Democratic former Governor Jerry Brown to ban fracking in California.  Mark Ruffalo is truly a progressive king. Anyways, moving on to the rest of the video. I believe personal action is extremely important. Even if everyone went vegan, the world will still face a climate crisis, but every personal act makes a slight difference. Voting, less flying, electric cars, solar panels, being vegan, etc. can and will make a difference if it happens in mass amounts. I know I will do whatever I can to limit my carbon footprint now. I will encourage my friends and family too as well, and have already begun so. I am encouraging my Trump supporting parents to support Bernie Sanders for President. They used to eat all foods, and now have given up red meat, and are considering eventually going fully vegan! Progress!




</p><hr>



<p>
After watching this lecture video, I was pretty surprised by the fact that Denmark has already taken its step to fix their climate crisis. I felt less worried and anxious because at least someone realized the importance of environmental protection. In Denmark, most people choose transportation with less carbon footprint. Some choose to ride bikes and some choose to ride the bus. In the south part of China, the government appeals to citizens to distinguish the trash. They distinguish the trash into four kinds. If anyone ignores it, the government has the right to charge them. I believe garbage classification is not easy to accomplish, but once it starts, it will have a snowball effect on our environment. I  think this is only way out for us to save our earth, I'm excited because I can see many countries are taking their actions. More and more people start to realize that "we only have one home".




</p><hr>



<p>

After watching this video, I've come to an unfortunate realization. To save the planet, we have to change our entire way of living. Everything from breakfast to how we get to work to where we sleep at night needs to change if we are to ever have a chance of saving this planet. And to be quite honest, I don't know if I see that happening without government intervention. People simply cannot care about a problem they aren't even affected by enough to change their entire lives. That being said, the solutions Ken has offered in this video would, in theory, be ideal solutions. 
 <br><br>


This is precisely why we need to start regularizing voting and making sure voters are educated in their decisions if they do choose to vote at all. Fracking and oil corporations have a vested interest in specific candidates who will ensure their ability to frack unhindered and unregulated and will thus contribute massively to their campaigns to ensure their victory. In the same way, we at the grassroots level need to spread awareness to candidates such as Bernie Sanders who are ready to face this climate problem and implement countermeasures as quickly as possible.
 <br><br>


With this being said, I am in no way suggesting you forgo all your climate helping habits, such as not eating meat or abandoning car/plane traveling. We ourselves must be the change that we want to see in others, so absolutely continue doing what you're doing to save the planet, and if you don't do it already, give it a shot. and while your at it, let others know what and why you are doing what you do. It's the best way to spread awareness to an issue that desperately needs it.

This lecture really broadens and vividly paints the idea and solutions that we as regular people can endorse for the betterment of this world. This lecture brought me the idea that our actions as individuals have a great impact even if we don't see them, because if we each do one little thing, it's like a chain reaction, expanding and creating a massive impact in the end. One of the facts of the video that really caught my attention was that, even if the whole world were to go vegan, it still wouldn't be enough to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. And that is because every single one of our actions create a carbon footprint and some sort of emission, so the future lies behind major lifestyle changes, including transportation, diet, and much more. It's also very overwhelming to think that many people around the world aren't so willing to make the efforts or sacrifices to really help the planet, it shows how selfish one can be, when confronted with a global issue, that only their own life lis upon, but millions of others. 
 <br><br>
Most of our daily lives revolve around the usage of petrol and fossil fuels, so if we could cut our use of fossil fuels it would massive aid in the battle  against time of this planet. The many solutions for cutting our emissions lies between our eyes, we just have be brave enough to grasp our chance and lead full on. 
 <br><br>
I am glad to be 18 and able to vote because it not only gives us this sense of personal power, but it helps us realize that our future is in our hands and we have a chance to control for once. Voting gives us a sense of entitlement over our future and knowing that every one of our votes counts truly shows how important every means to the future of this country. When you gives us this is sense of activism and freedom to vote, we have now successfully endorsed our thoughts for the future. That's what college is all about, finding yourself and who you truly are. Through our involvement in society we can find ourselves and help everybody else around us too.

I thought it was very timely of Ken to have mentioned bicycling in Copenhagen. Just by coincidence it had come up in a bit of a political discussion I had with a good friend recently. A conversation we were having on the socialization of health care, to which my friend strongly opposes, sort of transitioned into his concern for having is future income steeply taxed at the benefit of others. Although we disagreed on the original topic, I did understand his concern and wariness for inflated social programs. But the countries he most often mentioned as examples of the dangers of socialized health care were Nordic ones, such as Denmark. And I vividly remember him specifically mentioning all the bikes in Copenhagen as evidence that its citizens were taxed so much “they couldn’t even afford cars”.
 <br><br>
While there is some substance to this, taxes on gas, insurance, and automobiles are incredible in this region, and they make affording a car much less manageable, this expense has created a society and culture that appears much more desirable than the one our country has at the moment. This is where I realized my disagreement with my friend originated less from policy and more from a general disagreement about what a prosperous and successful society should be characterized by. This realization was very valuable to me, but it left me sort of worried. Much of the way I perceive the future of our country and our planet has been shaped by my academic experience, specifically within the environmental studies department. However, my friend is pursuing a very different educational path, and even though he’s at UCSB, I don’t think he willed be influenced to the same degree or even in the same direction that I have been. I worry that his rather conservative values may never be challenged, and they will continue to affect the way he votes, acts and consumes.
 <br><br>
But as his friend, I have an opportunity to at least engage him on this, although it’s often uncomfortable for us both. Hopefully with continued discussion I can at least help him consider other possibilities for our future. But is that enough?

After watching the video I came to the same understanding that I have had.  I have known that changing to a bike rather than a car would help the climate crisis tremendously.  I have also been knowing that it would be best to switch to a plant based diet.  I have known these things and I completely agree with it.  It would be best to begin doing these things, they would help the climate crisis in so many ways.  But what are the chances of the population actually doing them.  Most people including myself love eating meat and would have a very hard time switching to a strictly plant based diet.  As well as switching to only bike use, people love their cars and cars in general.  Many people would not want to bike from place to place for multiple reasons.  Laziness, they would get too tired, they would get really sweaty, their hair would look really bad etc…. I do think though that if it is enforced by not necessarily making rules about these things but making things to encourage it.  Such as making safe bike roads that run from place to place.  That way you do not have to worry about getting hit by a car on your way to work.  As well as I completely agree with the solution to ban fracking.  The only way is to vote, and this is true.  We need to have our voices heard, and vote to ban fracking.  People want many things, you can wish for many things but those desires will never happen unless you do something about it.

This video was very eye opening as to what I can do as an individual in order to help our suffering climate and what the true issues that need to be resolved are and the misconceptions about the two. First being that transportation is a much larger issue than meat even though the media tells us differently. Also, fracking is what makes up ⅔ of our greenhouse gas emissions as a nation. Fracking can not be resolved through personal action but there is a way we can help to end fracking.
  <br><br>
In the first weeks of this course I was beginning to get worried that there was nothing we could do because Ken had shot down many of the solutions I knew with scientific evidence such as electric cars and going vegetarian. But, after this lecture video I have a much better understanding of what is going to make the biggest difference and that is doing adequate research on policies and candidates up for election and taking the short time out of our days to vote. Another thing we can do is to become advocates for climate change policy and encourage others to do their research and vote in favor of the green new deal and other policies like it. 
 <br><br>
Flying less and consuming less animal products do also make a difference so we should not lose sight of how small changes make a difference. 
 <br><br>
Overall, get out there and vote (wisely!) and always think of more energy efficient ways to travel and consume.

Having just turned 18, I'm both excited and lucky to vote for my first time and to have it be the same year as the presidential election: possibly the most important election concerning the future of not only America, but also the potential political shifts that will solve the climate crisis. If America can follow Copenhagen's lead to become more environmentally friendly, it may mean a new chapter in our fight against global warming.
 <br><br>


However, the presidential election isn't the only election that deals with the climate crisis. Any seat of office, from mayor of Santa Barbara to governor of California can make an impact depending of their awareness of global warming. Coming back to Ken's example of Copenhagen, individual cities can make big strides to reduce carbon emissions. That being said, local elections are important as well. Like Ken said, it doesn't take a huge platform or a degree to make a significant difference. While huge commitments such as going vegan, or exchanging a car for a bike, all it takes is an hour or so through voting, and anyone can contribute to a better future.

I agree with the points made. From the beginning Ken has mentioned that voting is another way to contribute fighting against the climate crisis. Although our individual contribution and sacrifices to decrease our carbon footprint is, in the long term, making a difference; the biggest and fastest way to save our future or at least slow down the natural disasters is by tackling the problem from the top. These fossil fuel companies and other companies have all the power, and we need politicians that will take it away from them rather than support them. Thus, we need officials that aren't influenced by the fossil fuel industry, and who are willing to fight against the climate crisis through legislation. 
<br><br>
The fact that Copenhagen already has a lead on fighting the climate crisis, proves that we can do it too. Heck, we've seen less developed countries than us, completely change their economy to become environmentally friendly. Honestly, if anyone has the resources to do huge dramatical cultural changes it us, and it's sad to think that our politicians right now aren't doing anything. Im glad I have the privilege to vote, our current president and his office needs to go; I want to see new and more "woke" president by the end of the year...otherwise, there won't be another year to live.

For the first few weeks of this class, I was annoyed that Ken was such a hater towards technological advancements rather than sweeping cultural change. However, as time has passed I definitely understand and now agree with his viewpoint. The hope for some technological cure to our climate issues carbon footprint and methane emissions is not a guarantee. We have no idea if someone will be able to un-do our damage with some tech. But--we can implement personal changes, encourage others, and be active in supporting bigger local and national politicians to enact climate friendly legislation. THAT is something we CAN do and will always be an option. I have known this my whole life but this quarter especially I have been told numerous times how important it is to vote--and I definitely get it now. If we don’t have representatives fighting for climate friendly legislation, we have no power on a larger scale. That larger scale power is so necessary to implement real change across a wider population. Individual choices are great, but it “takes a village” or in this case will take the right people in the right seats to fight for our planet. It was disheartening to hear the four people have passed on their bicycles in Santa Barbara. These people made active choices to reduce their carbon footprint and get exercise and in return they lost their lives. We really do need to follow Copenhagen’s example and get more people on board for biking AND make it safe to do so. It surprises me that all of Santa Barbara is not super bike friendly as our campus is. Coming from Davis, CA I grew up biking to school, the store, and really wherever else I needed to go. The best part was that I felt safe the entire time because we have great bike lanes and greenbelts in place. I’ll definitely look into more bike activism and hope to see change in the future.

This lecture states the problem as I was worried about before. Ken mentioned multiple times that being a vegan and minimalist can greatly reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. However, even though we make ourselves a vegan, the climate crisis on the planet is still happening. The change in personal lifestyle can slightly reduces the progress of climate change, but overall, the save of energy and resources is too small to influence our planet. At this point, personal action is inspiring, but not the most effective approach to mitigate climate change. It does not mean that we don’t need to change our habits from eating meat to be a vegan, but we need to do more. Being politically activism might be difficult for most of us, but it’s not really a hard thing to be a climate activist. Some of us has already done the protest for climate crisis, which does not only persuade people to change their lifestyles, but put pressures on the government to work on the goals and projects they have drafted in the resolution, “The Green New Deal”.

I agree that it is greatly disheartening to come to terms with how little impact individual action has on the grand scale of the climate crisis. After all, there are about 7.7 billion other people on this planet; individually becoming a vegan or a minimalist as you mention is hardly remarkable when you look at the numbers. However, while these actions seem negligible on a statistical level, their social and cultural value are immeasurable. The influence of an individual is not something to squander; Ken mentions an excellent example: Greta Thunberg.
 <br><br>

The three roles Ken inquires about in this video lecture - personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active – are all crucial components of the sociological side of the climate battle. There is no “silver-bullet” solution to the issues we now face; I believe it is unreasonable to say one is more valuable than another when ultimately, all three should be enacted to achieve the ultimate goal of positive change.
 <br><br>

As I was already aware of how my own actions were not supremely significant numerically, it was not as depressing to me as another issue. I am currently on a STEM track, where the technological side of the climate crisis is often discussed and used as a medium to present different projects, research, and innovative work. I personally want to do my own field research in some wilderness capacity to better understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems and species as well as aid in the restoration and conservation of natural places. It is incredibly devastating to me that as an aspiring scientist, my future work may mean nothing; as Ken has repeatedly stated, knowledge is not power unless it is acted upon. We already have enough research and knowledge to act on, yet we aren’t. I am egregiously cynical about this, as I am dedicating my higher education to a field that is essentially null and void since politicians and corporation continue to stifle the science. Thus, the social, behavioral, and cultural change is all the more valuable to me. If there is to be value in my field again, the mentality must change first.


<br><hr>
After watching this lecture, I was somewhat discouraged about transitioning to a plant - based diet due to how Ken explained that even if we all went vegan, that wouldn’t help fight climate change as much as we thought. I agree with you that of course that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t give it a try or just completely eat meat wildly. On the contrary, it means we need to keep finding ways to ensure that we’re doing our part to fight this crisis. Moreover, considering that our generation has been more aware of the reality of climate change and are now old enough to vote, we can use this power to move in the right direction. The political activism of this generation is strong and very visible, so I believe we’re gradually making progress. Of course, this means we need to vote smart and do our research on politicians' perspective on climate change. It’s a well known fact that older people make up most of the voters percentage compared to any other group. This needs to change because the older generation doesn’t consider climate change a real problem, thus that’s not their main priority when voting and now we have politicians that don’t advocate for solutions to climate change.  Furthermore, I also appreciated how Ken included Copenhagen’s inspiring decision of using bikes as their main transportation mode rather than cars. I was surprised that this action does work out in real life because I always thought people would be more stubborn and hesitant to stop using their cars to get around. The fact that a small city like Copenhagen is leading such movement is admirable, a perfect example of how every city should function. To know that Copenhagen’s action is saving 3.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide from emitting to the atmosphere is mind - boggling. Now to think how much CO2 would be saved if the U.S. did the same thing as Copenhagen, we would be saving our planet in a whole new way.

I believe any one of these actions is an indispensable part of the solution to curb the climate crisis. Without personal action, the policies won’t be put in place because fewer people will support it and activism will fail to convince people; without activism, people won’t be motivated to do anything and informed of the issues related to the ongoing crisis, and regulations won’t be passed; without policies in place, people won’t be educated on the issue and the consumerism culture will go unchecked and ultimately it will lead to the inevitable extinction.
  <br><br>
  However I do think that taking personal action (coupled with education, scholar activism) is the most important issue because it is more or less a foundation for other activism and policy making. Although it will require extensive education on our generation and the many generations to come, if each one of us won’t start doing whatever is correct, other people won’t follow or believe what we are preaching. This is a tough situation we are in, as many children of this generation are taught that climate crisis is a hoax, it is troubling that even something as fundamental as education can be tainted.
 <br><br>
   Taking individual action is certainly a reachable goal, and we must take personal action right here and now. It is certainly the most important, but all three aspects need to move forward altogether to be able to push for a change.

After watching this weeks lecture video, I feel more grateful for coming to UCSB as we are a huge biking community. By biking to and from class or just around IV or the surrounding areas, we are saving millions of CO2 release into our atmosphere. It was astonishing to me how one small city saved 3.8 billion tons of C02 by switching over to bikes mostly. I think that making a day car-free by law is a great law to begin switching a community over to biking as done in Copenhagen. There are many benefits to biking as stated in this lecture video like the fact that one doesn't have to wait several minutes to wait for parking. There is also never a huge traffic jam, not including on UCSB, and you also get a beneficial workout daily. I think this a great way to begin reducing our country's carbon footprint aside from voting to end fracking. The only problem is that the bike infrastructure isn't good yet throughout the world. It is dangerous how a biker has to share the road with a car traveling up to 60 miles an hour. I feel like this is what stops many people from biking to busier spots throughout the city since it could be deadly. I feel like we need to vote to create bike lanes that well protected from any danger like cars. Once this occurs, more and more people will choose to begin to bike to work.

I really feel like the concept behind Ken’s video brought a large part of what we’ve been talking about in this class together. It was discouraging to hear that even if everybody on the planet went vegan — which of course won’t happen — it still wouldn’t be enough to mitigate the climate crisis. To be faced with the fact that individual lifestyle changes, no matter how significant they feel on a personal level, will not be enough to solve the climate crisis is disheartening but most of us feel like that’s the only thing we realistically have control over. However, even though they’re not enough on the largescale, such individual changes are hardly meaningless and I don’t think they should be discarded. 

  <br><br>

Of course, I think the main message of this video is that if we want to do enough soon enough to address the climate crisis before it’s too late, then what we really should be doing is combining. After all, it is a large group of people’s personal actions that have started every cultural, social, and political revolution. As Ken said, climate activism, being politically active, and individual lifestyle decisions are all tightly intertwined. One should not be shunned at the expense of the other. Finally, I think it’s a good reminder that we should just vote every four years when there is rampant media coverage for the presidential election. Every year we should be voting on a local and federal level. That, in itself, is a form of climate activism and a way to exert personal power on a larger scale.

As confirmed from the lecture video, I think the best and most effective way to help put an end to climate change is not going to be derived from just a single action we take of our own, such as reducing one’s animal product consumption, but from many other actions combined, starting with voting. Unfortunately, there is only so much we citizens can do on our own to reduce the negative consequences that come with climate change, but we do have a voice that we can use.
  <br><br>


Voting can be the first step for actual change to happen. Like Ken mentioned in the lecture video, biking could be a great way in helping reduce one’s carbon footprint, however, there is a lack of proper bike paths that keep bikers safe, which can make someone decide if they want to bike or not. I personally would not feel comfortable biking if there were cars driving 50+ mph beside me. I can see how this may make someone choose to drive their car instead of bike to their destination. The only thing we can do is to use our voices to push policy makers into doing something about it. We could vote for candidates that truly care about our opinions and beliefs because, in the end, they are the ones who will pass along our message and make laws to help solve the crisis. I believe that this combined with our own actions to lessen our carbon footprint is what can ultimately lead to change.

<p>
Now that I’m 18, I can’t wait for my chance to vote. The new generation is rising, and though it might have seemed repetitive when Ken kept saying that earlier this quarter through the videos, I truly feel what he means now and the power held in those words. I’m already taking it upon myself to change in other ways, such as cutting down my meat consumption but also biking here at UCSB. I use the bus instead of an uber to get to places like State St. or to the Goleta Amtrak station, public transport which needs to be improved upon heavily and hopefully will through activism. I have to admit, I’m terrified of biking alongside cars. Before coming to UCSB and relearning how to bike, I biked in the early mornings with my dad but as 8 am approached, I got really anxious because of how just a white line divides me and the cars. I like how bike lanes at UCSB are isolated and I feel safe in the sense that it’s me and other bikers, and I wish bike lanes were like that outside. Ken talking about the four people killed on that one street is just confirming my fears. I mean, I’m even anxious on Isla Vista though it’s bike friendly and much smaller than the city. Other than that, I have to step up and educate the people around me on issues that are crucial (like the obvious climate crisis) and its surrounding candidates.

<p>
The points that were made in this video by Ken reminded me a lot of the previous video we saw in lecture about the bike safety policies implemented in places such as Bogota and Denmark to increase the number of people who used biking as a primary form of transport. It was witnessed in those areas that creating a safer pathway dedicated solely for bike paths would reduce the number of people using cars and other forms of high carbon emission travel for transport, and that people genuinely enjoyed biking to work or other destinations once they got used to it. In the US it is a whole other story however. Bike paths are so cramped and dangerously close to speeding cars, making accidents and deaths so prone that no one wants to even use them to travel. Bike paths in my hometown are rarely used and are usually used more by cars to overtake other people instead of being for what theyre primarily used for. A couple months ago as well, a former classmate from my graduating class was hit and killed from an accident after a hit and run occurred during his bike ride. It was a very harrowing experience to hear about and truly made me angry knowing that the bike paths at my home are not safe in the first place, and his death likely could have been prevented if bike safety was a priority in the US. We really need to follow the examples of these other places who see this issue as a relevant cause for change. Whether it's popularizing bikes in the media for people of all ages to use (such as Ken's pedelec bike which I want to look more into for me to use) or implementing policies to create larger bike paths, these steps are necessary not just for reducing carbon emissions of our country but also for the safety and health of its citizens.

This lecture does broaden and vividly portray ideas and solutions that we, as ordinary people, can aim to improve in this world. This speech gave me the idea that even if we can't see them, our behavior as individuals has a huge impact, because if we each do a small thing, it's like a chain reaction, Constantly expanding and ultimately having a huge impact. One of the facts that really caught my attention to the video was that even if the entire world became vegan, it was still not enough to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. That's because each of our actions generates a carbon footprint and some form of emissions, so there will be major lifestyle changes in the future, including transportation, diet, and more. It is overwhelming that many people in the world are unwilling to make efforts or sacrifice to really help the planet, which shows that when facing global problems, only one's life can become very selfish millions People.
  <br><br>
Most of our daily lives revolve around the use of gasoline and fossil fuels, so if we can reduce our use of fossil fuels, it will be of great help to fight against this planet. Many of the solutions to reduce emissions are in our eyes, and we are just brave enough to seize opportunities and leverage our leadership. As outlined by Ken in most of this video, if we want to realize ourselves between fossil fuels, bicycling is essential to achieve great cultural change. When talking about Denmark in the video, I like "Don't drive on Sundays" is the favorite day for citizens. The Copenhagen example illustrates the possibility of this possibility, but it also illustrates the need for our politicians to create proper cycling lanes to encourage cycling and make it truly safe.

I appreciated this lecture for Ken a lot. I appreciate it because it made me feel a little less helpless about the climate crisis. Before this lecture, I believed that a plant-based or vegan diet, and riding our bikes could have a really big impact, but after watching Ken’s lecture it definitely proved this notion wrong for me. Although I will continue to try to change my diet and mode of transportation, I have to pay closer attention to the type of energy I am consuming. It doesn’t really make sense for me to make these changes, but not change other parts of my life which depend on energy from fracking or coal burning. Moving forward, I will try to be more aware of my energy sources and so should a lot of my peers.
   <br><br>
Another change I could easily make is to vote. Once again Ken really hit the nail on the head with his comment about voting being more powerful than what we individually can do to help the climate crisis. I would really like to research different policies related to the climate crisis and see how those changes will be implemented, and how society will be affected as a whole. By enough people doing this, I believe that we can finally see the changes that we have been wanting for so long. Without voting, we can’t possibly have fracking and other unclean energy sources eliminated or at least regulated.

I think Ken raised some good points. In the grand scheme of things personal change does not really impact as much because there are probably so many other people doing the opposite for every one person trying to change. I honestly thought that cows were the biggest producers of methane but apparently that is false. The most important thing we need to do as a country is to stop fracking and other industrial pollution from happening because it is the worst thing for our planet. I wish we could do more besides vote or switch from a car to an e-bike.

Sure performing different behavior changes that are eco friendly on your own are most definitely beneficial for our battle against the climate crisis, however it takes a lot of those small actions for a big change, requiring us to not only continue our small changes but to be an activist and promote larger change on a political level. This is what Ken seems to be getting at, I believe, and it seems to be absolutely logical and i agree with him. Whether it be promoting local legislation in your town to promote safer bike lanes or it be voting for an environmentally conscious presidential candidate your vote and participation all matter in times as crucial as these.

   <br><br>

On  a local level you can vote for safer bike lanes and other types of eco friendly legislation so that your entire community is inspired and pushed to take action. Safer bike lanes will persuade more people to bike rather than drive to certain places as well as pushing for public transportation if those are aswell somehow incentivized. On a larger scale activism is absolutely more important because it can have the effects that have been occurring on your local community on a much more grand national scale. With laws being in place to control emissions and wastes produced by huge corporations and eliminating our use of fossil fuels, a world leader that is environmentally conscious is insanely powerful. This is why if you are a climate activist your vote really does count.

<p>
Im laughing at the amount of comments mentioning your claim that you face no traffic on your E-bike. All jokes aside, I have never considered the whole E-Bike thing as an option and it honestly sounds like a personal change I could commit to immediately if the need came up. Drawing off of Gandhi's quote, its critical we value the individual changes we need to make if we are to truly call ourselves climate activists; we need to embody the change. Not going to lie, it's something I'm still finding it hard to do myself. Without going through this struggle, we can't possibly hope to call ourselves climate activists. 
   <br><br>

It just gets so hard to make these changes in myself when the options aren't there yet. Being environmentally conscious isn't "cool," as dumb as that sounds. Yea sure, vegan options are beginning to gain traction, but when I look at lack of infrastructure and support for things like biking, it truly is a turn off to trying to do what is right against climate change. Like i don't want to be biking to work or school in the future with cars zooming beside me and all I got is a little white line protecting me. 
   <br><br>

I feel like the culmination of fighting climate change through personal action or climate activism ultimately comes down to being politically active. True change won't come unless everyone is forced to adapt through the policies and laws we abide by. Unfortunately, it's a lot easier said than done, but making everyone go vegan or bike to commute is not gonna bring us zero emissions by 2050, so to me, preaching about our political efficacy is going to be the strategy that matters the most.

<p>
Before I watched this video, I have also been thinking about is it really enough if everyone one of us just simply become vegan and start to be more environmentally friendly and produce less greenhouse gases? The answer is obviously not after also hearing what Ken has said. And it is true that fracking has been the most serious cause for methane emission and it is something not easy to stop or have a complete end on fracking as we still need the natural gas for many production processes. I have taken an environmental science class before and I did a research paper on issues about fracking so I know how huge the impacts can be and how bad it can be to be caused to our planet. It has always been the most difficult issue to deal with.

   <br><br>

    To help make changes to the place we live, I believe voting is an important first step to start with. Many of us don’t see ourselves as someone who is like those leaders of organization/politicians can so think that we don’t have the power to change the current situation, but I want to say we do have;which is through voting. We vote for someone who believes in climate crisis and who is willing to lead people to take actions on helping to address the issues.

   <br><br>

     As an individual, even the small little thing we do don’t bring a huge obvious change to the problem, but it doesn’t mean the thing we do is useless. I started to bike a lot when I started school here in UCSB and I bike most of my time when I am going to campus or back to my apartment. Here it has good infrastructure for biking and I found it convenient and fun and I can treat it as a work out everyday if I bike. Even if I am not an activist, I can do it if it can help with the climate crisis. I am more than willing to do it.

I also had been wondering that question prior to watching this video because at times I have felt like no matter what I do it is not going to be good enough to get us out of this climate crisis. However I have realized that because most people in our society also feel this same way, it is preventing us from making changes in our own actions because we feel like they are just going to be useless. But if everyone took personal action, either by going vegan, giving in to consumerism less, and giving up car transportation there could be a significant amount of change. However like you addressed, I believe that voting is the most important thing we can do. As common citizens we have very little power over industries like the fossil fuel industry. The only way that we can try to exert our influence is to elect politicians who will make the changes we want to see. Therefore it is extremely important to go into elections knowing what each candidate supports and their plans to help the climate crisis. By being climate activists we can encourage politicians to make the changes that the people in their country want to see. We have done it before in the past with several different human rights issues, so I believe that we still can have an impact on getting rid of things like fracking and other nonrenewable energy. If everyone accepts that they have a responsibility to mitigating the climate crisis, we can all do it together and make significant change.

I agree with you that everyone could be the leader of this climate crisis. The rights we given to vote is an essential step to push toward an environmentally friendly and green planet. Some people may think that we do not have enough power to alter the current situation. Still, we actually could make a change if we all vote for the right person who is advocating solutions and approaches to save our planet. Besides voting, using public transportation and eating a plant-based diet are also personal actions that could contribute significant steps and progress in an environmental campaign. 
   <br><br>


I’m surprised that Copenhagen has an astonishing 62% of people commuting to work or school by bike. This bike activism is a real-life example of a possible change that other countries could try for reference. Additionally, after the energy crisis hits Denmark, people demand better infrastructure and safety for cyclists. Accordingly, it results in about 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 reduction from this small city. More importantly, the public’s demand forces city politicians to act. Copenhagen is the lead model of the world, and we should act on knowledge as what Copenhagen people do so that knowledge becomes power, which we have a better planet by the littles things we do.


<br><hr>
I also agree with you, voting is the most important I know several people who do not vote because they are not informed about politics or either because they don’t want to. I think people should be informed on how their vote does matter and that everyone needs to vote in order for the people who hold high political power can hear us. Every personal action has importance and it all starts with us to change our eating habits, form of transportation etc.  I know that ken said doing all that would do almost nothing to stop climate change I just hope people will continue to change their lifestyles to better the world.

Let me start out by saying that this is hands down my favorite video produced by Ken thus far. Throughout this course we have spent a lot of time discussing how personal changes in one's everyday life can help combat the climate crisis. What people need to realize is that this can only take us so far. The most effective way for our country to take action and make a change is to be politically active through activism and voting. As Super Tuesday approaches us it is so important that everyone goes out and votes. Essentially, this election can change the fate of our environment for better or for worse. Clearly our current politicians in office have done nothing progressive in regards to climate change, some do not even believe that it is a real thing (idiots). I was raised in a household where the importance of voting was stressed to both me and my little sister from a very young age, and I am so thankful for that. As I get older, I notice that there is a large population who have the power to vote but simply choose not to. To those people I always ask “why?” and the response is usually along the lines of “what difference does one vote make?”. This is the most infuriating thing to me. One vote can be what gets Trump out of office. One vote can elect someone who will better this country and, hopefully, the world. It is impossible to expect every single American to go vegan, stop driving cars, and to just change their entire lifestyle. Americans are notorious for being lazy and that is what makes it so hard to believe that everyone will take personal action in order to combat the climate crisis. What I do expect from every single American, however, is to take that hour to vote.

I completely agree, although personal lifestyle changes that are beneficial to our environment are important and should be valued, they really do only take us so far. What would push us even more forward would be to take political action. In previous videos, I remember many comments revolving around the fact that our political activism, such as spreading awareness and going on strikes, etc. help a lot but it needs to take a person with power--someone who holds an official government position to hear our voices and turn that into real action and change. It is important to exercise our right to vote so that officials can hear us and understand that our demands need to be met. I think everyone needs to start off with applying those small eco-friendly changes into their everyday habits and also to vote because every vote really does make a difference.

The two points that stuck to me throughout this video was the importance of voting and riding bikes. Everywhere, there is an emphasis that the best way to save the planet is by using public transportation, carpooling, and switching to a meatless diet. And for the longest time, I believed that. I believed that the only way I could inspire change was by walking and becoming vegetarian. However hearing your two points, and especially understanding the green new deal, I think being involved in the community and what happens in politics is very important. We have to be the change we want to see, and hopefully, we can inspire other people to do the same. But there are politicians, people running for office who also believe and want the same thing for the planet. And they may have a better hand of actually implementing those changes. The best thing that we could do is show our support. During the past elections, I could not vote yet because of my age but now that I am old enough, I definitely try to be educated on who I am voting for. I mean I was also aware of the past candidates despite not being able to vote, and that very fact did bother me. This is my opinion, but I think it is kinda unfair that the voting age starts at 18. Seeing as how younger generations will be dealing with the laws made by those voted for, I think we should have a greater say on who gets to be in office.  
   <br><br>

As for biking, I think your suggestion to advocate for better conditions and lanes for them was very necessary. Being from Los Angeles, the thought of biking always scared me and never felt like an option. There were times where I would be late for school and knew that biking would have gotten me there on time, but when I would bring it up to my parents, their immediate response was no. And I could not really blame them; we've known people in our lives who were injured badly or died from biking so I did not feel like I had a say to argue with them. Coming to Santa Barbara, and literally being told "bikes have the right of way" was a culture shock to me that I could not believe until my first year on campus. Seeing so many people biking to class and through Isla vista was amazing and so new, so weird to me in the best way possible. And I think that the way campus is structured plays a great part in why so many people bike here. The designated lanes throughout campus are so distributed and bike parking is all over. When you brought up how Copenhagen had a culture shift from cars to bikes when changes were made regarding their roads, I soaked up every word. I saw how Isla vista was a biking metropolitan and knew that if my city and other areas also dedicated roads to bikers and prioritized their safety through laws and regulations, more people would bike, and fewer people would carry the fear that my parents and I have for biking in large cities.

after watching this video, I realized there are a great number of things we could do to help our environment. First of all, we could drive less. Co2 emissions had so many negative influences to our atmosphere and it is one determine factor of why our environment is so damaged. Secondly, we can try to save up electronic sources by turning off lights when we are not at home or at the workplace. I have noticed that most shops or public area did not turn off their lights when it is not in their business hours. I believe this is waste of electric resources. Sometimes, a small step from everyone, it could be a huge progress for the enviroment and society.

I admit that every individual change can work together and reduce CO2 emissions to a large extent. After watching this video, I know about that we can firstly change our transportation methods like driving less and always going out on foot or by bikes. Because burning fossil fuels is very harmful for our environment and it contributes a lot to global warming. Second, we are supposed to save energy such as turning off bulbs in time if we do not need them. Because of large amounts of energy consumption during generating electricity, we should value the power. Additionally like Ken has mentioned many times before we are expected to be on a vegan diet to minimize CO2 emissions during the process of feed livestocks. All of these should have public attention so that we can combat climate crisis.

I think that this lecture video went over many concepts that we have already covered in class. To me, what stood out the most was the power of voting. We hear so often how important it is to enact change through voting. I think that using Copenhagen was a really good example of how changes don’t necessarily have to be made on the national level to make a difference. It’s always confused me why it’s sometimes difficult to get people to vote, especially the younger generations. I come from a country that is currently under military rule, and so I don’t even get the opportunity to vote to try to make a difference in terms of policies that can be implemented to help the climate crisis. It truly seems to me like such an amazing opportunity to vote and I think that every single person who has the ability to vote should not take it for granted. As much as I understand how it seems like the world isn’t set up for bike riders, it’s important that we realize the systems that are currently in place were created by humans, so I truly believe that it is possible to change these systems. Just because our system now isn’t suitable for bikes now, doesn’t mean it never can be. We should use Copenhagen as inspiration to promote change. Finally, I think it's difficult to rank the importance of personal action, climate activism and becoming politically active. I honestly think that these come hand in hand, and if we truly want to make a difference for our climate, we should embrace all three of these aspects simultaneously.

I really enjoyed the lecture video this week. It was really informative and taught me the importance of political activism. We can do our best to help solve the climate crisis, but large fracking companies make it difficult to lower CO2 emissions.

I strongly believe that personal action along with political activism  is the key to  change. Being an active voter for climate justice, but not implementing the same changes in your own life is contradictory and does not create any progress in mitigating the climate crisis.  It is important to vote to get the right representatives in office, but it is even more important to make active changes to your lifestyle.

This lecture addressed a lot of my concerns about Ken’s previous solutions. While I agree that personal changes are important and that small contributions add up and will make an overall difference, I do not think that it is possible to convince enough people to make these huge lifestyle changes. I am glad that Ken agrees with this fact and still sees hope in the situation. It is reassuring to know that while personal changes can help out in the overall picture, we do not have to be reliant on them in order to save the planet, and that instead the major changes need to be at the government and infrastructural levels (which can actually be regulated and largely changed with policy). 

<br><br>

Additionally, I did not know that local and state governments had power over fracking in certain areas. This is another reassuring fact, as policy changes do not have to go through the House/ Senate on a state level and are more likely to be rapidly placed into effect. I definitely believe that voting is the most important thing that any of can do to fight the climate crisis. It is also clear to see, as we saw in Copenhagen, that being politically active about this issue can have make real differences and lead to big changes on the local and national levels.

I agree that more needs to be done to address the gap between what actions are realistic from individuals and what actions are necessary from the government. Personal changes do make a difference and we should certainly implement those that make sense (financially, logistically, etc.) to our lifestyles. But moving beyond the focus on personal changes, I think what our individual role comes down to is our role in social movements. This role is what can bridge that gap. As individuals, we can make a huge difference by choosing to mobilize collectively: Starting with educating ourselves on local political processes and the ways we can access our elected officials to hold them accountable. There are so many organizations here on campus that do just that. I would love for there to be a way to make them more accessible so we can truly act as a collective to move the bold and uncompromising solutions necessary to address this crisis.

While I did find this lecture to be interesting, it was slightly discouraging how Ken stated that personal changes in our day to day lives and eating more plant based simply wouldn't be enough to make a difference because I feel like throughout the quarter he stated multiple times that  we all should make personal changes. However, I do agree that activism is very important and everyone should take part when they have the opportunity. It was very interesting to learn that Ken at 16 years old had made his own electric bike in the 70's! He was way ahead of his time in terms of climate change action. Its funny to me that Ken stated that he's never experienced a traffic jam in the bike path on campus because I've only been here for two quarters and I have experienced more than I can count. While he mentioned that many people have died in bike crashes along Modoc, I feel like 4 is not that bad compared to the amount of car crash deaths that occur. I think that if you live in Santa Barbara, commuting on a bike could be practical for many people it would just be harder to go longer distances like people who commute either out or into town on a day to day basis for work.

After watching this week’s lecture video, I felt certain that I’m on the right track of contributing to the issue of climate change by personal action, but not so much on climate activism or becoming politically active. First of all, to answer Ken’s question, I believe all three of the concepts are equally important when talking about which matters more. However, I would say personal action would be the most doable for me. When talking about activism, I am not a very social or out-going person, in fact, a shy and even a bit timid person. I feel very comfortable encouraging my friends, family, and people around me about ways we could do to contribute to the current crisis of climate change, but marching or striking would be a completely different case for me. Similarly, I have a strong will to get politically involved and active, but the most I can do is to inform my friends who can vote to make their bright decision, because I cannot vote.
<br><br>
I would continue with what I’m doing now, and if I got a chance in the future, I would definitely get more involved politically by practicing the right to vote.

It is difficult to be on the track of contributing to climate change, but I agree with you that the issue of climate change can be done by personal, individual action, not as much as contributing through climate activists or becoming politically active. Personal action is where you can make the tiny changes that overall help; legislation, via political action, helps, but overall the fight to help prevent climate change starts at home. Since taking this class, I’ve become much more aware of how my actions affect the earth around me; I’ve stopped driving my car as much, and have made an active effort to walk everywhere that I can.

After watching this week’s lecture video, I admire UCSB quite a bit more. No, we do not have the best bike paths, and yes there is bike traffic sometimes, although I agree it is nothing near as bad as car traffic. With UCSB and Isla vista basically being biking only we are really on the right track to helping the climate. Copenhagen is so far ahead of us on the biking but UCSB at least is doing its fair share.
<br><br>
The fact that Ken is devoting his life to educating the younger generationa and attempting to educate his own generation is awesome. If we had more people like Ken in office and the White House, America and the world would be on a better track to reducing our carbon emissions instead of the US is one of the worst for CO2 emissions.

I appreciate how Ken brought up Copenhagen's bike culture. I know that to some people, it feels as if we are going back in time with implementing more bike paths, but I know that it'll contribute to our carbon footprint. I'm not sure how people in the U.S. would feel about shifting to a whole different mode of transportation. Especially, one that may not be practical to those who are in a rush, or value their time differently. It makes me really happy though so to people in Copenhagen enjoy this mega bike path. I really like the idea of no cars for a day because it shows how much people rely on their cars. 

<br><br>

I also wanted to talk about how Ken mentioned the safety and dangers of bike paths. Riding a bike on the shoulder where cars are going 50+ MPH is incredibly scary and unsafe. I do believe that the U.S. needs to implement better and safer bike paths. Personally, I would find it hard to transition from a car to a bike. I do ride a bike here on campus and during rush hour, it's actually so scary and intense. People get into crashes all the time and the roundabout is an absolute mess. I'm surprised Ken hasn't experienced that and I hope he doesn't because it really is dangerous. But yes, people would have a hard time switching and just like the meat industry, I believe that there's a large number of people who wouldn't like that idea.

I agree that these changes are intimidating and difficult to make; that's why I feel political activism is so important especially on the grassroots level. Without beginning to participate in our own local governments, we can not hope to make these changes. I think that while there are large numbers of people who don't like the idea of the federal government making sweeping regulations to the whole nation, but I believe more people would be open to making these changes on county, city, or state-wide levels since the solutions can be more tailored to the individual socioeconomic landscapes of each area that way. Unfortunately a problem with this would be that people don't tend to participate in government past the presidential election, so getting people politically active on smaller levels is hugely important to solving issues such as transportation and agriculture. 
<br><br>

Personally, I don't know how we can enforce changes politically without becoming an excessively controlling state, so I feel that movements that focus on individual action will still remain important during the fight against climate change.

After watching this week’s lecture video, I felt like I have been reminded on how small my footprint is, compared to the world or planet. It is very humbling to realize that all the daily actions that emerged from the beginning of this course seemed to be ‘not enough’ in solving the climate crisis. Although, I already know that we must all practice the solutions that has been drawn to us by the course and the previous lecture videos by Ken, it seems that we as a society are failing to adapt or to commit towards this issue. The world would definitely be a utopian place if everyone on the planet switch their dietary methods to plant-based. Obviously, this method of everyone going vegan won’t be enough (sadly) to mitigate climate crisis. Everyone will be struggling to adapt this certain lifestyle due to their custom beliefs and personal taste in consuming their food. Furthermore, I found Ken’s remarks about fracking as a primary source, specifically,' ⅔ of our gas and transportation coming from fracking', to be completely alarming. Fracking is a risky business in extracting oil from the ground because not only that it puts so much pressure to the ground in suffocating our soil just so we could enjoy water and oil, we are abusing it and completely neglecting that it is heavily contributing to pollution and possible earthquakes that humans seems to be bound to experience. We should all definitely do something about this or it will be too late for us and the future generation. In which case, I believe our individual lifestyle changes in reacting against the climate crisis and Of course, our voting power will come in to play. I personally believe that our participation will be crucial in taking real actions to mitigate climate crisis. In fact, we are geared and capable in creating impactful changes towards our environment because we are already being exposed by different data and research in which we have the full lens of the cause and effect of climate crisis, the question just lies within us and our political participation in dealing with this crisis.

After watching this video I also realized how small my carbon footprint is and how much I can really affect global greenhouse emissions. Although I could cut my greenhouse emissions in half through taking many of the actions that have been laid out throughout this class, the amount of emissions globally that would actually be reduced is extremely insignificant. I agree with Ken that voting is the most important thing someone can do to help the environment and combat climate change. If you take some of the earlier logic from the course that if everyone switched to a largely plant based diet we could significantly reduce the emissions from methane, than if everyone voted for candidates that were in favor of sweeping legislation that would address climate change and push for reducing our emissions we could easily transform this country and reduce greenhouse emissions in many different areas of society. I also thought that Ken's talking points about electric bikes were interesting as I had no idea that an electric bike could travel 28 miles per hour. With the added benefits of not needing to worry about parking and commuting (at least for Ken) only takes a little more time I had no idea how good an alternative electric bike could be for reducing our emissions. However, despite these benefits it remains dangerous to bike but if the transportation infrastructure was changed, electric bikes could play a huge role in the future. What really surprised me was that the climate impact if American citizens swapped their cars for electric bikes would save 3.8 Billion pounds of CO2 for one small city in the U.S. After watching the entirety of this video I think that voting, changing personal habits, and becoming an activist all matter in addressing climate change and that a combination of all three is the best way to move forward. We could thus follow the past of the bicycle activists in Copenhagen and show that knowledge becomes power as bicycle activists created change by acting on the knowledge that CO2 emissions could drastically be reduced by becoming activists, voting, and changing the actions of our own lives.


<br><hr>
I agree that our individual footprint is a speck compared to how big the world is and how many people there are, but think about all the ~800 people that are in this class.  If everyone in class took Ken's advice to heart and began to live more sustainably, then that is 800 more people.  Those 800 people can then go to their friends and family, and educate them on what they have learned and encourage them to make small changes as well.  Now if those people's friends/family went and encouraged small changes to others, a wave of positive actions starts.  Even though your individual actions might seem small, by adding all the small individual actions of hundreds, and eventually thousands of people then a sizeable impact can start to be made!  I also agree that the amount of pollution and natural disasters that fracking causes is very alarming, and unfortunately, I think it is going to be one of the hardest things to stop doing.  People like cheap gas and power, and I think it is going to be very hard for the majority of the population to be ok with gas prices significantly increasing by stopping fracking.  People seem to freak out every time the prices go up, and I think the only way we can start moving closer to a change is through education.

This lecture was really interesting because it addressed the question that many people always wonder about climate change–will my personal actions really matter in the grand scheme of things? I know that I have asked myself that same question many times before. Even after learning about how the meat industry is a big contributor to global carbon emissions, I still reasoned in my head that it wouldn’t make a difference if I stopped eating meat or not. However, we can see how this mentality is dangerous. Imagine if everyone felt that way; then nothing would ever improve and cultural changes would never take place. Many people would argue that being more actively involved in politics and attending protests and events are more effective than our personal choices and practices, such as choosing to ride a bike instead of driving a car. However, I would argue that these “small” actions are our own personal forms of activism. Being an activist also means living the lifestyle, and our own individual actions coupled with the collective effort of others with the same goal can make a huge impact.
<br><br>


I especially liked Ken’s example that he used about the biking culture in Copenhagen. This example really explores the relationship and importance of the other forms of activism. I agree in the sense that in order for true change to take place and for Americans to make environmentally friendly choices, there has to be a change in culture. This means that we, as individuals, have the responsibility to ensure that we are making the right choices and do whatever we can to help mitigate the climate crisis. But also how we must also become politically active so that we can elect government officials who support reducing climate change. Being a climate activist may not be important to everyone and not everyone will be willing to go above and beyond for the cause, but we can all make small changes in our lives and make personal choices that will at least help mitigate the issue. Even voting is a very simple task, yet a lot of people my age don’t recognize the power of it. If we can all just do our part in making the best choices as possible, we are making a change. Although some would say that these small actions are insignificant, I would argue that with the right mindset and culture, it holds the power to do far more than we could probably imagine.

This lecture video in particular made me frustrated with myself. All this time, I've been taking cautionary measures to be as environmentally friendly as I can, such as carpooling, reducing my plastic waste, and only purchasing from brands that use recycled materials. This video made me think that all of my efforts, as well as everybody else's, basically doesn't matter at the end of the day because it won't make a difference. It feels discouraging to know that even if the whole world switched to a vegan diet, it still would not be enough to save our planet. The light at the end of the tunnel was Ken's suggestion to vote. Although on a personal scale, we cannot accomplish very much for the climate crisis ourselves, our legislators have the ability to actually make a difference. Choosing who runs our country will allow us to have people in power that align with our beliefs. This last presidential election has definitely caused our country to take a step back in the road to becoming green. Trump's main goals are to support big corporate businesses, including oil companies. If we all vote during this election, and encourage others to do so as well, our voices can be heard and we can make the changes that we want.

<br><br>

I personally do not like the idea of saying that personal actions do not matter. Although it may not do much, it does make a difference, no matter how big or small. Personal actions such as switching your light bulb or becoming vegan may not solve our climate crisis, but it does cause less emissions which is a step towards the right direction. I would encourage everyone to do their part in living a greener life, while also being an activist by voting. Just one or the other is not going to save us, so we must do them both.

I had very similar frustrations when watching Ken’s lecture video. I always thought that personal changes were the most important to help reduce global greenhouse gases. When learning that these personal changes were not the most important from activists such as Naomi Cline, it frustrated me. The personal changes not being important were really put into perspective when Ken stated that if everyone on the planet went vegan, it would not be nearly enough to save our environment. I always thought going vegan/vegetarian was a key factor in helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, however I was wrong. Instead of practicing personal changes, there is only one thing you have to do every couple hours per year to help mitigate the climate crisis. This one thing is to vote! I really didn’t think this simple thing was the answer to an ongoing question of how to fix the climate crisis. We as activists need to pressure politicians to act and inform them that we need legislation that ends fracking and other dangers that emit Co2. For example, a famous actor made a film called “Dear Governor Brown” to inform him that we needed to end fracking. We as activists don’t need to be famous to inform the public. While it may be harder to get attention from the public if we aren’t famous, it is still possible. I thought the topic on switching to bicycles was interesting. There are many perks to riding an electric bike including its reliability and practicality. We would get a good workout in, be able to find easy parking, and avoid traffic jams. However, there is one issue with riding bikes and that is the dangers it can cause. When we think about bike lanes, we think about a white line painted on the street that separates the bikes from the cars. Due to this many bike accidents resulting in death happen which makes people not inclined to ride bikes. With this being said, we need to force politicians to implement safer and more reliable bike paths. Compared to Copenhagen we do not have great biking systems, and if this were to change I think more people would be inclined to riding electric bikes. As activists we need to fix this and force politicians to make changes. We are the ones that will make this happen and we need to do it now.

According to you, “Personal changes will not be enough to mitigate the climate crisis.” This statement is demotivating. If we keep thinking this way, everything will remain the same until our Earth becomes uninhabitable. I agree with you, no matter how big or small, every difference counts. Personal actions such as taking shorter showers, eating less meat, and using public transportations are important daily reminders that add up. If we all made a small difference, together we can make a big one. For example, if more people started biking to work and school, the government may notice and create larger and safer bike lanes.
<br><br>

While it is highly unlikely that one person can completely mitigate the climate crisis, I believe anyone can support climate change. For instance, Greta Thurnberg. She was once a normal student with an idea and now she has transformed into an influential figure. It does not take fame to make a difference in the world. In fact, voting is one of the easiest ways to encourage change. Voting in local, state, and federal election ensures that the leaders we want have the power to alter legislation. While a single vote may not seem significant, it has the potential to put an end to major climate crisis issues such as fracking. Ending the climate crisis is a team effort.

<br><hr>
Ya, it's very unsettling to know that all the steps that we as individuals are taking, like reducing our meat consumption or carpooling, are really not enough to mitigate the climate crisis. Though our actions may not solve the climate crisis in its entirety, it sets an example and shows to the rest of the world our values and intention to make a difference in the world. I think that in itself is powerful. But what is most necessary and will have the biggest impact is taking the time to vote. As college students, we can only do so much on an individual basis... we need to give our vote to those who have the power to make change on a national and global scale. Choosing who creates our laws and regulations will allow us to have power and, in turn, align the political system with our beliefs. If we take just an hour out of our lives to vote during this election, and encourage others to do so as well, we can quite literally change the world.

I echo your sentiment throughout this comment. I always believed that using enviromentally friendly products and taking extra time to recycle or do other things was my own way to help the planet. It was a bit disheartening to discover how minute of an effect these actions really have. The vegan fact in particular was quite shocking. After all we have learned about how much of an impact our diet has on our carbon footprint, I definitely thought something like the world going vegan would be a huge part of the resolution. Ultimately though, I agree with Ken's main point- everyone must vote. Its good to see how much this is encouraged at a school like UCSB, where many of the popular spots on campus have people asking if you have registered to vote yet. This election seems straightforward for the health of our planet: we have already seen Trump's view on climate change, so there seems to be only one option. It appears all the democratic candidates are in agreement about human impact on the planet, so no matter who wins, they must gain the environmentally conscious person's vote.

I definitely understand your frustration of feeling that personal changes you implement in order to do good for the environment somehow does not add up to much. It is very hard to advocate for and commit to such personal changes when in the back of your head you know it really will not make a difference. It also does not help that personal changes that can be made such as biking instead of driving are not suited for most areas, including my hometown. I had dreams of taking my bike home to ride all summer and stop emitting 1/4 of my carbon emissions just from my car, but honestly I am scared. People drive bad, and like Ken mentioned, those little white stripes on the road meant to separate me from moving vehicles is not a "bike lane." I do not think I would ever ride my bike further than a five minute distance from my home. It sucks, but as you said, changing for a good reason is worth something even if it is small in the grand scale of things. It is at this point when voting becomes the utmost importance. I am not sure how it works, but I know that those who we elect into office have the power to make safe, designated bike lanes. They have all the power and capabilities of implementing the changes we need to mitigate the climate crisis period. Trump does make these things seem impossible, and I am not sure what the future election holds, but I hope it's people who care about our planet. We must vote, and importantly encourage our friends to vote, because it is our generation that shares these concerns over older generations. It is now past the deadline to vote but if you haven't then Ken has already given us other ways to help the climate crisis!

After watching this lecture, I was also left feeling discouraged. I felt that I had wasted all time I have spent biking to work (as opposed to driving) or growing my own produce (as opposed to buying it) or researching which deodorant brands are the most sustainable (as opposed to buying the best smelling one). One of the main points of Ken’s lecture was that personal changes are not enough. Instead, Ken advocates for political action and voting for candidates that support climate change policies. Though I agree that political action and voting in local, state, and national elections are paramount to combating climate change, however, I believe that it is actually harmful to dismiss the power of personal actions. 

<br><br>

Personal actions have an immense amount of power. Even if personal actions are not as powerful as political action, it is disadvantageous to go around telling people this, as it risks making people feel powerless and demoralized. Personal action can give people hope and remind them that they are making a difference. It is very easy to think that your personal actions do not matter and therefore you can buy that two-dollar shirt at H&M or eat that burger or fly to that business conference. However, if everyone believes that their personal actions matter, they will hopefully be more inclined to alter their lifestyle to become more sustainable.

<br><hr>
I felt exactly the same when Ken was hypocritical in his claims that taking personal action may not hold as much weight as we thought. In last week's lecture in particular, when Ken stated how being vegan doesn't really make a difference, it really confused me on what we should actually do to mitigate the crisis when everything we do does not do as much as we thought. Society has popularized the wrong solutions as the true way to try and stop it from spreading, such as using reusable straws to save the turtles or taking shorter showers to save California from going into another drought. These last few lectures made me feel as if my personal effort made no difference, but in today's lecture, it was completely contradicted so it left me quite confused on what actually was true. Is me going vegan actually doing anything when the most detrimental problem is refridgetorial management? How am I going to stop deforestation with my reusable straw? It is hard when you are only one person and you know your voice cannot be heard, so Ken's solution to voting is truly the light at the end of the tunnel like you said. We took 10 steps back in the last 4 years due to who is in office, and we have to work 100x harder to try and reclaim everything that once was no matter how hard it might be because our future depends on it. The solutions do not lie in our physical changes at this point, but rather the one true privilege we have: our voice and our right to vote. By supporting those who claim to make the changes you want, we get closer and closer to treating this crisis once and for all.

Although I agree with the above comments that it’s discouraging to hear that my personal efforts in being sustainable doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, I think it’ll be lazy if we just all gave up all efforts and relied purely on the polls. Yes, obviously voting for people who can actually implement green legislation is on top of the list of how individuals can make large changes, but if no one made an effort in reducing their waste or eating less animal product, then how doesn’t that just make our footprints worse? And doesn’t that all add up?Although big figures like politicians and corporation leaders are largely responsible for global emissions and waste, if we use that as an excuse to fully enjoy our first world luxury such as eating meat and driving, then just sit back and complain, what does that say about us as greedy Americans?

While I can’t help but agree with the idea that the most widespread changes are achieved through regulations or policies brought about through climate or political activism, it’s hard for me to disregard the scale of impact lifestyle changes can have on the planet. Lifestyle changes, when popularized, can drive businesses to change their practices or products because they’re constantly looking to meet the demands of the consumer. For instance, dairy industries have begun to fall out of popularity over the past few years because consumers are choosing to support vegan options for milk products such as oat, almond, or soy milk instead. On the policy side, voting for tighter restrictions will force businesses to comply with environmental regulations, however, social movements such as voting with our money and shifting consumer culture also play a large role in whether or not businesses practice sustainability. 
<br><br>


I think when comparing personal action, climate activism, and political activism, it’s not a question of which matters more, but a question of how they can be practiced simultaneously to the largest extent. It’s more a question of and how environmental degradation can be eliminated at the source through serious life changes or commitments whether it be through veganism, freeganism, or anti-fracking political action rather than by simple acts such as shopping less or ridesharing more often.

I totally agree! Voting is obviously the easiest way to make sweeping, large-scale changes, even though it’s unfortunately an act that many Americans take for granted or ignore altogether. As you said, however, “voting with your dollars” is extremely important in pressuring companies to change. If people stop buying meat, or dairy, or gasoline, etc., the demand will plummet and the industries will be forced to change or to fail. Because of this, the importance of both activism and personal action cannot be downplayed.

<br><br>

It can be harder to make personal changes though if the government is not backing you up, as Ken pointed out. For example, if there is no safe biking infrastructure, then choosing biking as your main form of commute may be unreliable, dangerous, or downright deadly. If we get the government to support such changes though, and to build the needed infrastructure, then it will become much easier for people to make a personal decision like this. As Ken said in his lecture on a climate vanguard, things will be much more difficult for the first people who adopt such changes, but as the government gets behind it, it will become easier and more widespread. So it’s important both to lead by personal example, and to work for widespread political change.

After watching this video I felt like I knew what to do in order to play my part in saving the planet. The most significant thing I can do is vote. This year I turned 18, so in the upcoming election I will not only vote, but I will vote smart. I will do research beforehand in order to know which candidates will dedicate their time in office to restoring the planet. Along with this, I will continue changing my daily habits in order to live a more sustainable life. My goal is to cut my meat consumption down drastically and only to buy clothes from second hand stores. I already always ride my bike as transportation while I live here at UCSB. When I go back home for the summer I hope to continue to use my bike as my primary mode of transportation around town. I will also start to take it upon myself to make my friends and family aware of when they are not making environmentally conscious decisions. This may include informing them that they should use their power as a citizen to vote, or calling them out when they are wasteful with food or other resources.

I also plan to adopt a similar plan to yours. I have already cut meat from my diet, and this summer I hope to transition to a vegan diet. One thing I love about uscb Is the bike culture, and I plan to use my bike as my primary source of transportation during the summer. One of the biggest challenges so far has been convincing my family of the impact they have on the environment. Everyone is concerned about anything but the environment, and when I try to shed some light, it always goes through one ear and out the other. But I'm not going to lose hope. Ive had plenty of conversations with my mother and she has started to understand where I'm coming from and what I'm trying to say. My mother as well as my family were heavy meat consumers, and  when my Mother saw how I have removed meat from my diet and why, she began to incorporate less meat in her cooking. However, there is still much more space for improvement for both my Mother and I.

I must admit that its extremely frustrating to see the sheer ignorance the people have on climate change, but I always remember that there are people that are pushing this agenda of climate denialism and ignorance on the public, that pour millions into think tanks and schemes to keep the public in the dark.


<br><hr>
I really liked both of your anecdotes as well as Ken’s clear explanation breaking up individual actions into 3 categories. To share my personal actions, I am also striving to buy only second-hand items, educating myself on zero-waste actions, working my way towards becoming vegetarian, and trying to waste less food. I already compost and have gotten my housemates to compost with me, ride my bike often, and feel my urge to buy decrease as time goes by. I am politically active, and as Gina stated, “I will not only vote, but will vote smart.” With that being said, it definitely takes time educating yourself on politics so that you can vote smart. Whether that be watching debates and interviews, researching on the Internet, or physically speaking with campaign volunteers, that time adds up. Being politically active is absolutely necessary and the act of actually voting is very low-commitment, but being politically active and literate on politics, in reality, I think requires more dedication. Lastly, I don’t think I’ve ever marched in an activist march or truly been a member of an activist group, which makes me consider making it a goal to participate in climate activism at least once this year (Earth Day is coming up!) It is important to exercise all 3 forms of action, and I think personal action is still necessary because little change is still change. It also makes me feel fulfilled because I am doing something to help a good cause.

I also plan to adapt my life to be more environmentally conscious. I am ready to vote at the upcoming election and will do my research beforehand. I have been trying to consume less beef since learning about the consequences of this class. I also do not own a car at the moment and I bike or walk most places. I understand it is not an issue at the moment because IV and UCSB are very bike-friendly but I am not sure how to implement this habit once I move back home. As stated there are no safe and convenient bike routes present in most of America and in addition, public transport is not efficient and honestly, where I am from they are not very safe. Using a car is the only logical way to get around and this problem can only truly be solved by voting because no personal change can help with that issue. Truly one of the most important things to create change is to vote and convince others to vote as well. I have already been informing my parents and colleagues about the climate crisis and the importance of voting so I hope they follow through. Quite honestly before this class I would have never voted nor registered, but the information I gained has driven me to do what I can.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with all the points you have mentioned, however I become a bit discouraged when it comes to politics. Of course, I will vote, because every vote counts toward what I believe/know what is right. When our own president does not believe in climate change or mocks about it, that’s where I begin to doubt a lot of things. We have seen how people with high political power will say that climate change is not happening because they have their own money invested in oil companies. My goal this year is to try to live a more sustainable healthy lifestyle and try to slowly change the eating habits of my family back at home. I will try to eat a more plant-based diet, go thrifting/shop less, and try to bike or walk everywhere I possibly can. Inform those around me to the best of my ability because more people need to be aware of how easy it can be to fight against climate change.

<br><hr>
I like how you said that you wouldn't just vote, but "vote smart." I also plan to do the same. As someone who has a great privilege to vote, I feel that it is my duty to not just vote, but to educate myself about the candidates and policies proposed. I think the worst thing that someone could do who has the privilege to vote is to vote blindly. By blindly voting I mean voting on guesses and random assumptions. For further clarification, imagine you are at a polling station. The ballot is in front of you and you have no idea who the people or policies are, so you randomly select whichever name and answer sounds best. I cannot stress this enough, in the words of Gina, “VOTE SMART.” 
<br><br>

When I think about voting, I like to remind myself that there is a huge population of people in the US who cannot vote for various reasons, but will still be subject to whatever policies and people we agree to. So vote smart because you want a better future, and if not that, vote for those who cannot.

<br><hr>

I think personal accountability is important, especially because it leads to a better understanding of what your responsibilities are when dealing with climate issues. However, I don't think that those changes are enough. They could easily be forced upon something with specific legislation. Becoming politically active should be important, yet there are too many politicians who I feel are having their pockets lined by big oil corporations. Furthermore, the way our government works means that to actually pass the laws needed, democrats would have to control the house, and that's a lot to ask for. Not impossible, but highly improbable. I think real change could happen if politicians were scared for their positions. If entire cities began to take charge and demand change, fear of not being reelected could motivate many politicians. In conclusion, the best you can do is make changes in your personal life and encourage activism to make changes more widespread. And you are absolutely right that our vote should match our morals.

UCSB does a great job at trying to implement sustainable practices, and I pride myself in being able to get my education here. Before I could even vote, I interned for a city council candidate in my hometown and went door to door encouraging people to vote for him and educate the people on his policies, as well as help them register to vote if they had not yet. I noticed UCSB is extremely proactive in voter registration. The first day I moved into my dorm, I had to attend a mandatory meeting where I was given the chance to register to vote in California. I have been stopped by students near the arbor and prompted by students before lectures to register to vote if I had not already as well. The massive biking culture here is great as well, and biking off campus in Isla Vista is preferable than driving a car. I won't need a car as a student here, which is different to my friend who attend college in other parts of the country. To do my part, I have been educating myself on politicians and seriously considering the best option. I want to encourage my friends to do this as well, and especially encourage them to vote. I have been purchasing most of my clothing from thrift stores as a teenager, mostly because it is cost effective and a fun experience, but I want to maintain this habit. As far as meat consumption goes, I refuse to eat beef and many dairy products and base my diet heavily on sustainably sourced vegetables and fruits with some poultry here and there. I go to the AS food bank at the UCen to take advantage of the fruits and vegetables not used in the dining halls, and try to eat everything I take at meals. These changes are small and I know not everyone can keep up with sustainable practices 100% of the time, but is important that people are aware of what they can do and be mindful of how they are living their lives.

I agree with you that one of the most significant things we can do to save our planet is to vote. And not just vote, but vote smart. It is important to let our voices be heard when our planet is dying. This will be my second time voting, as I was able to vote in the county elections in 2018, but I will be doing even more research as we will be voting for president and a number of other things. I think it is important to encourage everyone that can vote, to vote. Especially people our age and those who will have the chance to vote for the first time. I hope that all the young people that have turned 18 since the last presidential election come out in numbers and show the polls that, as the years go by, we are the ones that will be making changes and deciding who to put into office. 
<br><br>
 Although it is difficult to become an activist and dedicate our lives to the climate crisis. We can at least support those who do. Personal action, which can be challenging to give up things we have been accustomed to our whole lives, is one thing we must try to do. Whether that be lowering our meat consumption, flying less, or using public transportation, every little thing counts. I also hope to encourage family and friends to take personal action and cut down on their carbon footprint. All three of these things equally matter and we should be doing our best to make a change.

<br><hr>


I agree with you. After weeks of learning about climate change and how we can reduce our carbon footprint, I knew what kind of lifestyle and changes I need to do for my part in reducing climate change. First, change my diet. Because livestock, especially beef, is a big contributor to climate change, I feel like I can not completely go to a plant-based diet so in turn I will consume meats like chicken and implement that with plant-based foods to optimize the best way I could eat. Second, my mode of transportation. Because UCSB mainly requires you to travel on a bike or walk to get to classes, we are already doing what we should do to reduce climate change. This is one of the reason's I admire UCSB. Lastly, living a lifestyle of minimalism. I try to strain away from the consumption of goods and clothes I do want and only purchasing the necessary goods I need, This helps me feel better about how I save my money and it has made me realized that living simply makes me much happier.


<br><hr>

I am also trying to take meat out of my diet. So far, I have stopped eating beef and pork and hopefully, at some point, I will be able to take meat out completely. I am a pretty picky eater so a lot of times the only things available for me are turkey or chicken, so I usually eat that stuff a lot. However, I'm trying to eat pasta and salad more often to avoid this. In terms of voting, I too just turned 18 and will be voting for the first time this election. After doing lots of research on potential candidates, I very very quickly eliminated Trump as an option. Moderates like Biden, Buttigieg, and Bloomberg present their own issues. Bloomberg specifically is a strong proponent of fracking and denies its negative effects on the environment. Biden and Buttigieg have yet to propose any comprehensive plans, but I am skeptical they would be willing to pass swift and drastic policies to address the urgency of this issue. Especially considering both of them are trying to "compromise" with Republicans who are literally paid off by the oil lobby. Meaning anything passed by them will be much weaker. Between Warren and Bernie, it appears that Bernie has taken the front runner position and Warren is seemingly falling out of favor. If progressives truly want a candidate to make sweeping changes, it would make sense to unify behind the one progressive with a good chance at the nomination, Bernie. If you want to read Bernie's green new deal (which received an A from every environmental organization) the link is: https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/green-new-deal/ or you can look up "Bernie green new deal"  This was just my view of the "voting smart" idea but read the deal yourself and see what you think. The plan is INCREDIBLY comprehensive and addresses agriculture's impact on the climate incredibly specifically. One notable statistic mentioned in his plan was "According to research at the Rodale Institute, agriculture could sequester 37 gigatons of carbon annually worldwide. Sadly, just 10 percent of farmers receive 75 percent of agricultural subsidies in the U.S., and those subsidies don’t prioritize carbon sequestration or soil health. We need to start by supporting all farmers not just a wealthy few and incentivizing conservation, not over-production." I think reading this plan is a really good start in order to vote smart in this election.
<br><hr>
I love this comment a lot because it's very similar to my way of thinking. I turned 18 last year and voted for the first time then, but I definitely didn't do my due diligence. This time around, I'm trying to be very proactive in looking at candidates and what they're really fighting for and against. I definitely want to exercise my right to vote and I feel like to fully do that I need to make sure I'm informed. I know my friends are looking forward to voting, too, but I'm not sure if everyone is doing the research to know who they want to stand for, so I'm going to try to be more vocal about making sure they know what their vote will be going towards. As for the other things you said, I have recently become vegetarian, which is honestly a pretty easy change for me, which I feel good about for the planet, and I as well bike everywhere while on campus. I know I'm guilty of driving a lot when I'm home, but in the summer when the weather is good, I do try to bike and walk a lot of places, so I'll just make sure to make that a conscious choice this summer. I know that I probably shop too frequently from non-second hand stores and that's definitely something I've started to work on since taking this class, and I think I'm taking strides in the right direction. These are all pretty simple ways that I feel like I can do my part, and they're really not as hard as they may have seemed in the beginning, although I do know I have a long way still to go.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you said Gina. I am an international student, so voting does not work for me, but i think i will support the one who always dedicate to the environment issues on my social media in order to let more international students pay more attention to these kinds of problem. However, the second thing you have mentioned made me feel sorry about what I always do. I was too lazy to ride a bike so i usually drive my car to school because of the convenience. In this way, i think i will try to ride a bike to school if i have enough time. From my perspective, saving our environment is not that hard because all of us can do the things that come from our daily lives just like riding a bike.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, taking this class and watching Ken’s video lectures have made me realize that one of the effective things I can do to help the planet is vote for trustworthy candidates that share the same climate values as I do. However, I do worry that I will vote for a candidate who claims to be a big climate activist, but then in office fails to realize or act upon the claims they made. Although I like to hope that a politician would not do this to their supporters, I feel that it is difficult to sift through what politicians claim just to garner support and donations, versus what they will actually do. This is a bit of a pessimistic view, but for this reason I believe that personal choices are of the same importance as the decision to vote. Through personal choices, we can ensure that we are always fighting against the climate crisis, rather than idly waiting for a politician to come and guide us. If everyone were to act through their personal and political means, the path to healing the climate and building a more sustainable global culture would be streamlined.

<br><hr>
 I agree with you. After watching this lecture video, I found that I could actually be small but have a great effect on saving the planet. I also think that voting is a really really good way that could make a significant positive effect towards our better planet. This year is 2020, and this March, we can participate in the presidential election. This is a great opportunity we have to help the United States lead the way to save our planet. This election will be my first time to vote for a president, and I will also vote smartly and consider a lot about the environmental policies.
 <br><br>

Besides from the election, I agree with Ken that driving is not a good way to commute, but biking is. California often has traffic jams in the morning and afternoon. This are the time I go to school and leave school, which often takes me more time to reach my destinations. I think our nation could be done more to promote alternative environmentally friendly traffic methods. Biking lanes and skateboarding paths on the campus are really good, but there are no bike lanes that go to the Henley Gate directly from my house. This could be improved by pushing some construction policies. I really like what Denmark government has done to save the planet. Cycling is a really good way to help our poor earth, there is no traffic jam, and the side effect is we, humans, get healthier by exercising more.


<br><hr>

I agree with Gina, and Ken for that matter, that as young people in the United States, the best thing we can do to make a big impact is to vote, and as Gina said, to vote smart. Ken mentions personal action, political action, and climate activism as three ways to help cut down on carbon emissions. I already do not eat any red meat, so I know that that is helping cut down my personal carbon footprint. Also, like Gina said, I use my bicycle to get around at school on a daily basis. I used the bus last year as well. Both busing and biking cuts down on my personal emissions. 
 <br><br>
I thought it was interesting that Ken asked “are personal actions enough”, because I truly believe that if you are doing something, no matter how big or small, to help reduce your climate footprint, you are doing something to help the planet. Sometimes, it is good to start small, whether that is taking part in meatless Mondays, or using less disposable plastics. Nothing that you are doing to help prevent global warming should be overlooked because it makes a small impact. 
 <br><br>
I also enjoyed Gina’s comment that she “will also start to take it upon [herself] to make [her] friends and family aware of when they are not making environmentally conscious decisions”. This was a great idea, I thought, because encouraging others around us, who are not necessarily in this class, to make decisions to help cut down their own personal emissions is a great way to start living more sustainably.

<br><hr>
This video showed me that I can play an important role in the future of our planet. I now know that voting is the most important thing that I can do. I used to think that voting was unimportant and it wouldn't make a difference if I voted or not. Now that I am better educated on voting I will start doing research to see who the best candidates for dealing with climate change. I will also vote for state and local officials wisely. I will also start using my bike when I go home rather than my car. The only problem is that my city doesn't have great bike lanes, so I'm scared that someone might hit me. 
 <br><br>
What was crazy to me was that if everyone went vegan, it still wouldn't be enough to put an end to climate change. That just shows how much of an impact big corporations are making. We need to find politicians that will put an end to the corporations. If we don't no matter how much we lower our individual carbon footprint it will not be enough.

<br><hr>

It's kinda crazy to think how different our world will be if everyone were to simultaneously follow the course of lifestyle change that you have written. Although it is unrealistic for that change to happen overnight, it is a definitely realistic to see this change happen over the course of the next decade. People will be reluctant at first since as this means stripping away many of the harmful luxuries that they take for granted, but with time, people will realize this will be the only course of action in order to keep our world healthy for future generations to enjoy/thrive. Despite time not being on our side as we are currently nearing the tipping point of irreversible damage to our Earth, I am completely optimistic that this lifestyle change can occur. I feel like these past few Democratic primary elections have displayed just that, as the front runner is also the candidate that has the strongest agenda for reversing climate change. The future bright.

<br><hr>
This a perfect plan of action. The best thing we can do as citizens is to fully exercise our rights and vote for candidates that have a means of bettering the climate situation. People might think, "what will a vote change?", but this exact mindset is what leads to the downfall of a country: when the power shifts from the public to the politicians. When we vote, we don't just vote for the person, but also their policies, and people sometimes forget that. The policymakers do implement these laws, so it is our duty to the environment to elect those who will advocate for the health of our planet. Personally, I know many who believe that their vote does not matter, but it takes a group effort, or the same result will happen. But once again, people must be educated in terms of the policies of candidates and on the climate crisis. Politicians hesitate from taking extreme action on behalf of our climate as it would be a direct threat to the capitalist system that facilitates it and therefore, a threat to the many luxuries that we have. But it is necessary as we have to begin thinking about our own personal safety, if anything, which will no longer be guaranteed as the planet is moving towards uninhabitable conditions. We are selfish creatures, so it will take a direct threat to one's own well-being to fully motivate them to live sustainable life. Obviously this mainly applies to climate crisis deniers, but there are also many who choose to ignore, which has a similarly negative effect.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you and Ken mentioned in the video, that voting is the most important action you can take regarding the climate crisis. It is extremely important in the upcoming local and national elections that we do our part to look into the candidates we are voting for, and not only read about what they stand for, but what actions and plans they have to solve these issues. I think that if we are to make any systematic change to help reduce climate disasters it is important to get government intervention and help set regulations on a national level. 
 <br><br>

I also make daily life choices that I will continue to make, such as, not eating meat and biking rather than driving, and I think that all of our efforts are important, even if they seem small. Regarding your comment on meat consumption, I found that it was a lot easier to cut meat out of my diet than I had expected. I do still eat fish, which I think helps the transition, but overall I don't miss eating meat and have felt healthier since not consuming especially red meat. I am interested in trying to cut dairy out of my diet because I know that animal products have a very negative impact on our environment.


<br><hr>
I watched a video a long time ago saying "Our representatives including the president don't pass bills based on their own beliefs, but the beliefs of the country in order to stay popular among their base", and watching Ken's presentation showed me how important voting and showing what I believe in is. Like you, I turned 18 this year. Unfortunately, when I got my ballot to vote in my election I did think about what I should pick for certain policies but when voting for local leaders I just circled the one on the top. I thought it wasn't too important, it was an election for back home and didn't really apply to me in Santa Barbara and it was just a local election. However, watching this video and the remembering the statement I said previously shows me how important my vote is and how important practicing what you preach is. Just like you, I plan to vote smart in the future and vote for candidates that believe in climate change. On top of that, I will practice what I preach and be a part of a new generation that is focused on helping the future.
<br><hr>
I admire your plan to become more environmentally and politically conscious after viewing this video. I am also trying to take little steps in order to reduce my impact on the environment, but I feel like this video has energized me to start taking way bigger steps!  I still need to review and research the upcoming candidates for this election, but I know I have to be very thorough with my research. As for transportation, I do not drive nor bike, but I prefer walking everywhere instead. I know this will be difficult if I want to go to further places, but I'd rather take public transportation in those cases.



<br><hr>
I will also vote smart and do research on the candidates before voting. I also have been striving to make more environmentally conscious decisions. Now that I am at UCSB, I ride my bike everywhere and if I ever go into town, I take the bus. I also am trying to cut down on my red meat consumption. Burgers are one of my favorite foods, but I try to only eat them in the dining commons when they have the blended burger, which is half beef half mushroom. While there is still beef in these burgers, there is a lot less which halves the environmentally impact of my meal. While it is not realistically possible to end the consumption of beef in the United States, alternatives which are more environmentally friendly are a good solution. I think if there were a lot more good tasting, affordable, alternatives to red meat, the consumption of red meat would go down a lot in the United States.
<br><hr>
I resonated with your goals about being more environmentally conscientious. As an individual I also plan on only buying clothing from second-hand stores, cutting my meat consumption, and using public transportation. I also want to be politically active and discuss the importance of voting with my community. I like the statement that Ken made, "knowledge is power if but into action by activists". I think this is so true because knowledge is something that is kept in the mind until somebody makes an effort to educate others and spread the message. At the end of the day, I want to have a positive impact on our environment and continue to have conservations with people about what we can do as individuals to eliminate our carbon footprint. I also think it is important that as activists we do not try to ridicule or shame people for their actions, but to inform them that what they are doing can be harmful to our environment.

I like Ken's perspective on these different ways we can help mitigate the climate crisis. Yes, it is important that we do the personal things like eat a largely plant-based diet to lower our climate footprint and set an example to others, but it also very important to be activists and bring about the change we want to see - or embody it as Ken mentioned Gandhi said, which I believe is the best way to bring about any change. However, political action and voting is also very important. Fracking is gross and terrible for our environment and should not be happening in our beautiful state and nation. I am very thankful for people like Mark Ruffalo who made that film to the governor - but it is also up to us to do what we can to bring about this important change and end to fracking letting politicians know.
 <br><br>


 As Ken outlined for the majority of this video, biking is super important in bringing about a large cultural change if we want to ween ourselves off fossil fuels. I loved how in the video when talking about Denmark, that "no car Sunday" was the citizens' favorite day. The example of Copenhagen shows how possible this is, but also how necessary it is for our politicians to create proper bike lanes to encourage biking and make it actually safe. Earlier this year I biked from UCSB to Santa Barabara Bowl (until I got a flat) to see Bob Dylan playing. The bike ride is not safe, and I am not very inclined to make it again. With proper bike lanes and infrastructure however, this is a change that can transform our culture in a great way.

In watching this week's lecture video, I reflected on the possibility of changing our transportation system to more bike friendly and the large impact it can have on our environment. In order to achieve this and be more like Copenhagen and other places, we have to consider things such as safety and creating more bike lanes. As part of our personal action regarding transportation, we can persuade the public to choose public transportation or bikes instead of their cars. People need to know the significance of transportation and the way that making choices plays a role in possibly reducing our carbon footprints. 
 <br><br>
Local and national transportation and the way it impacts the climate crisis relates to voting outcomes. More than ever, I value the power in voting and the significant change it can bring by representing our voices. Yet,  I know many people who simply do not vote due to apathy or because they do not know the extent to which certain issues affect us at the local and national level. What if people were more aware and less apathetic toward certain issues like the climate crisis? As students, we have the necessary tools and resources to reach out and have higher voting outcomes. Overall, voting is important when it comes to dealing with the climate crisis and the injustices tied with it. By making the choice to vote, voices are heard and policies are passed both at the local and national level that can make the world a better place.

I agree with your statement, "I value the power in voting and the significant change it can bring by representing our voices. Yet,  I know many people who simply do not vote due to apathy or not knowing the extent to which certain issues affect us at the local and national level." This year will be the first year I will be able to vote and I have always been excited  to see the election outcomes on November 8. However on November 8 2016 I saw a shift in my family and community. They like everyone I know truly believed in the importance in voting however with Trump winning the presidency, they lost hope. They could not believe an apathetic, TV personality and climate change denier won presidency. For four years I have watched disaster after disaster and see Trump dismiss it as "socialist propaganda" in a tweet. By taking this class however my passion for voting has renewed. We are no longer in a position to keep voting climate change deniers into office we must back the right people who want to make a change. The ones who are willing to change legislature on agriculture, transportation, food, oil and fashion industries as well as trade agreements but most importantly on climate change agreements such as the Green New Deal.

One thing that has stuck with me since Ken showed it to us was the Superblock system in Barcelona, Spain. The city is attempting to retake control of the roads for the pedestrian. This is through the reduction of blocks into larger "superblocks" that span the area of a few normal city blocks.With these large blocks, the city added bike lanes in replacement of the streets of these blocks and opening them to pedestrians. 
 <br><br>
This plan has a few benefits. One, road maintenance is cheaper, since less roads are being used in the city. Biker and pedestrian safety is ensured, since they aren't encountering so many cars. And, finally, public transportation has become simpler, with less stops and less intersections. All in all, a superblock system could benefit a place like Isla Vista. Imagine IV with no cars lining the streets, or having to deal with pesky bikers jumping out of intersections in front of cars. This would greatly reduce the carbon footprint cars have in IV, and ultimately make IV a safer and more active community by forcing them to walk, bike, or skate.

This will be my first year being able to vote. It was exciting to know it’d be voting season right after my 18th birthday. At first, filling out the ballot was kind of nerve racking, but it didn’t really take that long. I had done some research on the candidates and people walking around Isla Vista making sure everyone was registered did a good job on informing me about the candidates and answering any questions I had as well. Like Ken said, you really don’t need more than an hour to make these very important decisions. It’s probably the easiest, fastest, and most efficient way to have your voice heard. You can make this one decision that will impact so many around you and you don’t really even have to leave your home. I was already pretty excited, but Ken made me realize this experience was so much more than just a rite of turning 18.

This will be my first year voting as well, and I'm excited to finally be able to! During high school I always followed elections, and it was always frustrating when I couldn't voice my own opinion in the same way as everyone who was voting, so I am looking forward to being able to this year. I very strongly believe in the importance of political participation, and I think not voting when you have the option to is failing yourself and your country, and a disregard of your civic duty. Just this week, I found it surprising how many of my peers told me they weren't sure if they were going to vote, for a number of reasons: lack of awareness, little political efficacy, shortage of time, or because they "just don't like politics."  It was almost baffling to me that so many of my peers--who, like me, are at this school because they worked hard and want an education--could even consider not voting. All it takes is a little bit of time to educate yourself on candidates and policies, and just a little more time to fill in some bubbles. Our democracy needs our political participation to be truly representative, and our climate needs our participation if we have any hope of saving it. There are so many young individuals that understand the crisis and want to fight for the environment, but the low turnout rate of our age group is detrimental to the process. Older age groups have much higher turnout rates, and they're the ones that are more likely to vote against climate solutions; thus, we NEED to show up and rock the vote. If we do, we may actually have a hope of getting the representative into power that are going to fight for us, our planet, and our future.

I really enjoyed how Ken took time to emphasize that any action is a step in the right direction while also urging us to do more than personal lifestyle changes. I enjoyed how he chose to focus the scope of this video on bikes and the auto industry rather than the meet industry. As Ken points out, the idea of riding a bike as opposed to a car is very uncool. In contrast veganism and vegetarianism have recently be re branded to be a somewhat fashionable change, commonly practiced by actors, influencers, and other societal role models. Ken makes this whole video focusing on the power of voting and politics which is, of course, very important; however, I think it is important to also consider the power of more organic avenues of change. The aforementioned popularization of veganism has not caused everyone to become vegan, however, it has caused a 600% increase in veganism in the past three years. If this sort of cultural change were to occur again, this time focusing on popularizing E bikes, the impact could be staggering. Even if the result was half of the vegan movement, a 300% increase in bike riding over driving would eliminate 100 million cars from the road. As Ken stated, this trend twords alternative transportation began to occur in the 70s but was ultimately short lived when the pressure to do so was lifted. If the pressures were internally, however, it is likely that this change would only continue to gather momentum while also influencing societal changes in other aspects of our lives. I do agree that political action is a viable option for those looking to mitigate climate change, however, I think that alternative methods have the capacity to be more effective and better received.

I love being 18 and taking this class. It's so great that everything Ken says applies to me, which really helps with the feeling of hopelessness often attached to learning about the climate crisis. I am excited that 2020 is an election year, and the first one that I am able to participate in. I cannot wait to have my voice be heard and be able to make an impact on my country. I also love being 18 because the rebellious spirit is high in myself and my friends. I enjoy being an activist and utilizing all the power that I have. This lecture video made me very hopeful for my ability to participate in this climate crisis and be on the right side of history. This year has brought newfound power and this class has brought newfound information that I will not let go to waste. I don't have to be Mark Ruffalo or Leonardo DiCaprio. I can make a change and demand that my voice be heard.

I love what you said about making your voice heard on your own! We can be activists without being in the spotlight or being famous. Part of being an activist is just actively engaging others in change and living your life as an example to others. Actively being conscious of our habits and being mindful of their impacts on the planet is a small form of activism in my mind. This election year is a big deal but only if we all participate. If we don’t vote then the same population of voters that has historically voted will continue to have the advantage over policy. We are the generation that can create change because we are ready to accept it. I feel like past generations have blindly put carbon into the atmosphere without thinking of anything other than how it would advance businesses and human life to have fossil fuels. Today we are global citizens that care about the well being of our home as well as the advancement of our biodiversity on the planet. There is no reason that humans and our livestock should take up 97% of the biomass on the planet. We have ruthlessly taken over. The only was to change this is to be active about the changes we want to see.

This mindset is the right one to have during such a crucial time of our lives. It is important to be aware of all the politics going on and follow through in voting on what ideas you believe matter. Many people think that their vote does not matter when in reality it is critical to our lives as the people we choose to make and enforce these laws affect our daily lives. It is important to think of changing our eating habit to plant based diets and waste less resources like water and electricity. But it is also important to participate in directing into changing their actions to benefit the climate crisis. And the best way to do that is through voting. We are the voice of the younger generations, the generations that will have to deal with the effects of climate change. It is our duty to speak our minds through voting as that is a way we as a mass can state what we want to those who hold power.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed hearing your thoughts about just how powerful voting is and how it can give ordinary people a voice even when they feel like they might be insignificant in the giant sea of celebrities and well-known people who are being heard. While I completely agree I just wanted to expand and talk about how this opportunity to vote is taken away from so many people due to the racism that is still present in our country. As we have discussed so much in this class, voting is incredibly important because along with personal action and partaking in climate activism, it is a key part of solving the climate crisis. Unfortunately a lot of people are unable to participate in all three actions of these key actions because of policies that discriminate against people of color.

 <br><br>

Since the beginning of our country’s history we have seen that only certain people have had the right to vote. The fight for women’s suffrage and African American suffrage were just two of the many incredibly intense and dangerous situations where people put their lives on the line just to have their voices heard. Women did not gain the right to vote until 1920, African Americans could not vote until 1870, and I could go on and on about the long string of voting amendments that people have fought for over the years. In more recent years the new blocks on voting can be seen in laws present in many southern states as well as in the practice of Gerrymandering. While I am a bit rusty on my history and could definitely benefit from doing more research, I am well aware that there are still racist practices happening today that lower the percent of people of color that are voting, and that this is a serious issue. If anyone is more well versed in the issue and can comment further on this topic I would love to hear what you have to say!
 <br><br>


I am so glad that, as you mentioned, our generation has a rebellious spirit that encourages us to go to climate protests and I have high hopes that this year the turn out for new, young voters will be high. It is incredible that so many of us have the opportunity to vote, and it is so imperative that we do not take this right for granted and take the chance to make our own voices heard, and that we speak for those who cannot.

It is awesome that Professor Ken explains a lot of personal
action for us to reduce carbon emission. Changing to a plant-based diet or take
public transportation to travel are both plausible and efficient ways to act. However,
for hydraulic fracturing or fracking, we cannot solve it or reduce it by
personal actions. The only way but also the best way suggested by Professor Ken
is to vote.




 <br><br>

As an international student, voting is excellent because you are
choosing a leader who can promote positive policy and make a whole country to
change. Being in the University, I’ve seen many students involving in voting
and actively participated in it. These active students also make a call to
other fellow students to vote. A vote can make a real change. I also think of one
example form Korea. There is a Korean movie called Silenced. The movie talks
about a heartbreaking truth that many hearing-impaired children, both boys, and
girls, were hurt sexually and endure physical abuse at a school. The movie
promoted South Korea to pass a law to protect these children from being hurt.
Votes are the same. Using your voting power to help to promote the development
of society and push forward to protect the earth by having a righteous leader.
Local, state and federal elections are all important and critical. 


 <br><br>



While voting can make a more world-wide influence, riding a bike
instead of driving to work is also worth to do. 62% of people in Copenhagen
choose to ride bikes and it helps to reduce 3.8 million carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere. What if people in the US or other European cities can take
action. Much more CO2 will be reduced

After watching this lecture video. I like this story that claims the methods which Denmark utilized. Like I have said before, Ken's video can always give us many things to reflect on our own. Denmark definitely is a good example for every country in this world.
<br><br>
The citizens of Denmark realize their climate footprint may cause a serious result that will come back to them. That's why many people take their actions to save the earth. Their actions may seem small, but as the time goes, we can see the good result for it. Most of their citizens choose to ride bikes instead of driving, and some of them choose to go to work or school. Those actions begin a snowball effect on the environmental issues. Year after year, the number of vehicles in Denmark decreases. But in the United States the number of cars increases year after year. People seem to forget that the climate footprint will cause serious disasters. We have to believe that our personal contributions can make a big difference to this world.

The citizens in Denmark know that rising sea levels could put them out of a place to live but that's also true for Americans living in coastal cities. In previous videos we saw that some people straight up reject the fact that the sea level will rise and flood their cities. I feel that in order to spark change, people need to feel that here is a danger or consequence and misinformation has played such a large part in making people believe that nothing bad will happen. I think until most Americans realize this, there will not be such sweeping change like Denmark and other frontrunners in combating climate change have. The people that are informed and are able to change things need to come together and create a big movement that informs people about the danger of climate change and act accordingly, from taking small personal steps to activism and voting and making sure that politicians know that climate change is something the people care about.

I really agreed with the primary message of this particular lecture. While I supported the personal lifestyle changes that Ken was proposing in the previous lectures, in the back of my mind I was always thinking that these were not realistic because not everyone would adopt them. So when I heard Ken reiterate that changes in the climate behavior of one individual will not be enough, I realized that the message of the class was larger than just one person.
<br><br>
When Ken started talking about Fracking, I felt that he again made excellent points about what will be necessary to stop extraction in this manner. A single person’s actions will not be enough to stop these large corporations, we need to take collective action and use our voices to make a change. The fact that half of the oil and two-thirds of the gas extracted in the US is from fracking not only demonstrates how reliant our economy is on this practice but also has larger implications for the damage that it causes for our planet as a whole.
<br><br>
I also found the example of Copenhagen to be very inspiring, not only was the city able to switch to a commuting system with fewer carbon emissions, but it was done on a local level. The government saw that there needed to be changed after the first energy crisis, and they took action to start making changes. What I found most inspiring about this, however, was that this was a gradual process. The integration of bike paths did not occur overnight, but twenty years later it has significantly reduced the country’s carbon emissions. 
<br><br>
My main take away from this particular video lecture was that the sooner that we start taking action, the better our planet will be for it. Like the people of Copenhagen voted for politicians and actions that benefited the planet, we can do the same thing in the United States. And the sooner we start, the better. By supporting policies such as the Green New Deal, we take the first step towards making real change through climate activism.

<p>
Although it is encouraging to hear how other countries have made amazing progress towards being more sustainable, it is also pretty hard to come to the realization that the US has done little to help the environment. Copenhagen's bike system is so inspiring, and being a part of a campus that is so reliant upon bikes makes it seem that a country to commutes short distances by bike is not so unreasonable after all. Biking gets me where I want to be in a short time, burns some calories, and has no emissions. Yes, cars are still necessary, but if we were to just use them less, this would greatly help the environment. 
<br><br>


As far as the question as to which matters the most, I believe all three are direly important. Not all of us are going to be climate activists, but each of us can take important, small steps in our daily life to reduce our carbon footprint. Lastly, it is SO important to vote. Even in the local elections. For example, one candidate (bruce porter) is currently being backed by big oil who wants to continue to drill in our central coast oceans. However, if enough people take action and vote against him, this is one way we can help the environment in a big way- even though it's only our LOCAL election!

I appreciate how you mention the importance of voting locally! I truly hope Ken shows this comment in lecture so the class can become aware of the candidate you mentioned, Bruce Porter, and do their own research on the policies he supports and furthermore who is backing him financially in this election. While it is of obvious importance to vote in the big elections, such as the presidential and primary elections, I often see that voting locally is generally overlooked despite the fact it can have the most immediate impact on your own community! Therefore, I hope others can become aware about how the big capitalist industries, such as the oil, coal and fracking industries have the power to influence local legislation against the fight to combat the climate crisis.


<br><hr>
I agree with your points. It is practical and even more efficient to use bikes for short-distance travel. It is true that bikes can't replace the car completely since cars are more comfortable and faster in long-distance. However, we can, like you said, reduce the unnecessary use of them. Based on my personal experience, biking to the class is somehow more efficient than driving. Therefore, why not biking? However, I also have a concern about increasing biking. In campus, when it is about lunchtime,  there is a tremendous number of the bike, which sometimes cause the "traffic jam" for bikes, especially in the crossroad. If more people start to bike, the efficiency of bikes may decrease. To solve this, the government should reinforce the investment on bike path. If the policy doesn't cooperate, the advantages of bikes will go, and people prefer cars again, making a wired dead circle. 
<br><br>
What I want to say is that personal action is not enough to solve the problem.

<p>
After watching Ken's lecture video, I learned how important and effective an individual's action can be. At first, I thought that one single person cannot simply change what is going on right now because how can such a small individual affect other people's actions around the world? However, I realized that I extremely underestimated what one's actions can do. For example, when one of my friends told me that she will go vegan because it will save the environment, I thought: how can one person quitting her intake of dairy and meat change the world? but now I realize, it is possible. She decided to commit to her journey of becoming vegan because she was influenced by other people who decided to go on that journey too. It really only takes a spark to create a fire. One's aspirations and goals to help the environment can inspire others to do the same or even more. I hope others around the world can see the vision that I have earned after watching videos and listening to Ken's great lectures for weeks.

i agree with your statement about how ones actions can have an impressive impact on other people. As ken mentioned, Simply being the change you want to see will lead to people having natural curiosities about your different perspectives. Without pushing your agenda on other people, it will create a ripple effect in which people will natural follow in your foot steps as long as you are respectful other other peoples opinions. Although many people will say were past these small individual changes, and go about not doing anything different, We must not fall into the trap that we are too small to make these changes matter adn that we should continue going about what we do because our individual choices will not make a large impact. It's these mind sets that will led to the destruction of our planet.

For this lecture again I feel as though the things we need to do to make a change are doable but without the support of politicians and officials it makes it that much harder. Having to create change in our lives and in the world is harder for some more than others, and to top it off not being supported by those in power is such a let down. What i mean by this is the bike example that Ken states. The idea of making bike riding a daily thing to go to work and stuff like that is great (even though I hate biking because it's scary, I'd do it). However, the fact that there really is no safe way to bike ride because there's no structure to allow people to bike to their destinations is the problem. We need officials to make those spaces for us, but the frustrating part is we not only have to demand that, but also hope people get on board as well which is also really hard. Ken said that people have died here in Santa Barbara because we don't have appropriate bike paths that are not crowded by cars. I am a clumsy person and always on edge when I'm on my bike here on campus so I could never feel safe biking in the street where cars are going at 50mph or higher! But I also want to try to bike places because having a car involves finding parking, paying for parking, gas money, traffic etc. are all not it (huge props to Ken for biking to work!). I think that activism is such a huge part of all of us achieving everything that can save our planet and ourselves. Getting more people on board with this is my personal goal, and just introducing them to these things without forcing it upon them because I find that when doing that it only discourages.

I completely agree, there is only so much each person can do. For example, I can't afford to go vegan and manage my vitamin deficiencies, so instead I cut back on my read meat consumption, and try to eat more plants and poultry. Voting in our generation is so crucial because older generations have learned to show up to the booths to get what they want. I'm terrified that people get killed on bikes so often, especially considering that bikes really are a low-cost alternative to driving. This is systematic violence that encourages everyone to strain their budget to buy and maintain a car, which in turn endangers more low income people. The disadvantaged people get poorer and die, and car manufacturers continue their relentless advertising and social brainwash. Bikes are so cute, I've seen so many people fantasize about living in Copenhagen and riding their bikes everywhere, flowers and bread in their basket. That world could be here. We just need to make it be. People would be happier, better exercised, and be able to fully understand the maintenance of their vehicle, which is also very complicated when it comes to cars. I'm so nervous and thrilled to see how this voting cycle goes, because it really will be a huge difference between empowering people who want to protect our planet and silencing them.

I believe that Copenhagan has laid the perfect groundwork for the rest of the world to follow. Copenhagan replacing their cars with bikes, and significantly reducing their carbon footprint is what we all need to do in order to solve this problem. College campuses are a perfect example of where there are more bikes than cars, and I am sure that most would agree that having a bike on campus is much more convenient than having a car. For example, if you were to have a car on campus and were to purchase a parking permit, that would cost a couple of hundred dollars just for one school year, you can only park in certain parking lots on campus at certain times and days, so you would still have to walk to your classes and other places on campus. With a bike on campus you can get from place to place efficiently and get to park right next to your dorm room or class, without the high costs of having to pay for gas, a parking permit, or insurance. Copenhagan shows that we can all switch over to having bikes, and that cars are not necessary. You can get from place to place without having a car, and not only will you be helping the environment but you would also benefit financially. 
<br><br>
We all need to make sacrifices in an effort to save our planet. While going on a vegan or vegetarian diet has become trendy, it is also a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Although you must keep in mind that while you may think that you are making a difference by switching over to a plant based diet, you have to be sure that the vegetables that you are buying are locally grown, because if they are not that means that are flown in from other places. Planes are the fastest way to release the most amount of emissions, so while you may be saving the planet from methane, the carbon that is released by the plane makes up for it and leaves you in the same position.

Last year, due to familial obligation, I spent most weekends in Dana Point despite living and going to school full time at UCSB. Having to drive over 300 miles every weekend through LA, I've encountered enough traffic jams to really appreciate Ken's recommendation of electric bikes. My dad discovered them a few years ago and my entire family loves them. My family, as well as our close group of family friends, all own multiple electric bikes that serve as our main form of transportation around town and especially when we all get together. Electric Bikes have served us all very well and provided many benefits. These benefits include saving money on gas, eliminating any possibility of driving a car while intoxicated, and being really fun (some can get up to 30mph, its awesome). 
<br><br>
I, among many others in Isla Vista, have brought cars with them to school whether it be for work, travel, or convenience. In my case, I primarily use my car to get to work. It is seemingly integral to my income. What I have found, however, is that if I were to instead ditch my car and get an electric bike instead, I would save a fortune in gas, insurance, and maintenance. Even if I were to buy a brand new, fancy electric bike, I would still have spent significantly less money than I would on maintaining my car. 
<br><br>
They may seem like a large expense, but one should consider an electric bike as a form of capital. The investment in sustainable transportation would eventually pay for itself multiple times over.

Within this course, I’ve continually questioned the ability I have as an individual to play with regard to the climate crisis. As presented by Ken, I would have to agree that it is important to start with your own patterns/practices and see how you alter them to adapt to the reality that yes, the climate crisis is actually happening.
<br><br>
As a first year, coming from one of the warmest places in CA, (The Coachella Valley), I was initially shocked by the amount of public transportation infrastructure that we have readily available here in the SB county. For many of the norcal friends I’ve met here at UCSB they’ve mentioned that if anything our infrastructure is lacking, with the travel times with Amtrak and public bussing. But to me, this is an entirely new experience, as the only useful mode of transportation is by Sun line bus running throughout the valley. While we do have bike lanes, that are much like the ones explained by Ken, they are incredibly dangerous. A couple blocks from my house, a bike lane and turn lane intersect, crossing over one another, almost to ‘swap’ sides. My initial thought as a driver was that this was sort of annoying, but as I’ve become accustomed to the biking culture here on campus, it’s also of great danger. Out of the examples included within the lecture video, Copenhagen’s approach of separate lanes is interesting and something if it could be adopted, could really become a widespread phenomenon. Although in a place as that I call home, this isn’t necessarily plausible, as it’s often extremely hot during the summer and late spring months, that a separate road such as the one proposed would often not be used. Within our local elections, homelessness and infrastructure building have been of major concern. Ken’s right in that if we wish for change to be seen now on a widespread scale, involvement and voting both play a huge role. Ultimately, it is my goal to see what can be done in our community, but also on a national scale with regard to public transportation.

I agree. Throughout the past few weeks I’ve thought my individual actions won’t play a large role in the climate crisis. Ken went over issues such as cars, planes, food waste and plant based diets and every time I played the devil's advocate saying I don’t think I could do what Ken suggests and if I did the impact would be minimal. In order for personal action to make a large and effective difference, there would have to be mass, widespread personal action. A large population of people would have to move to a plant based diet, stop using cars, and use other mass transits besides planes. Moving from a car to a bike might seem simple but most places don’t have safe infrastructure for bikes as well as they aren’t as practical as a car. My home town is in the central valley, where most people drive a car. We don’t have effective mass transportation like larger cities (e.g. New York, Boston, San Francisco) I’d agree that what Copenhagen did was incredible and that I wish that was practical for all of the United States, however, it is not. 
<br><br>
In this case I would have to say climate activism and being politically active are more effective than personal action. Voting is a simple action US citizens can do to make a change. It is indeed our civic duty to vote. However with voting comes education. The public needs to be aware of the issues we face and the actions we can take to solve them. People need to be politically educated in order to know who to vote for. Education also plays an important role in activism, as people become aware of the issues we face, more can take part in advocating measures to reduce climate change.

After watching the video, I conclude that we must simultaneously give consideration to personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active. As an international student in the U.S., I think the first two approaches can be used anywhere, whereas I cannot become politically active such as voting. Ken did a great job in this lecture to reflect what we have learned before and asked us to ponder over the issue in a comprehensive way. I learned that although personal actions such as switching to a largely plant-based diet are not nearly enough, they have special roles in reminding ourselves the mission of mitigating climate crisis through daily life activity. Moreover, I broaden my insight after thinking about the comparison between the U.S. and Copenhagen. If other cities or countries can do some thing (building better bicycle infrastructure in this example), why our countries cannot do it? I also associate it with the bicycle infrastructure in my hometown, Hangzhou, China. In my city, almost every main roads have separated wide bicycle roads beside motorways. Between the bicycle roads and the motorways, usually there are green belts or rails. This make bicycling more safe so that many Chinese choose to commute through bike. Furthermore, I visited Japan several times and I think its public transportation is so convenient and developed and I don’t even consider cars when travel in the city. All in all, we could gain different useful ideas when comparing to other countries and we can absorb some advantages through active political activity. I would continually focus on my personal actions while trying more to impact the decisions of the government.

I strongly agree with paying attention to all three facets of personal action, climate activism, and being politically active because initiating change requires action on all fronts. Personal action can only go so far but setting an example for others to follow is the best way to go along on an individual level. While voting is an active decision we make, I do feel like it is still passive in the overall process of passing legislation. Some candidates can put on a front during elections and contribute nothing of use throughout their term. Overall I feel like we should be adopting useful practices from other countries and reorganizing our infrastructure, like incorporating public transportation as the main method of getting to places.

Living in Los Angeles almost all my life, I have never really thought life without a car would be possible for me. As Ken has said many times it's just the culture of our country. But living in Santa Barbara has exposed me to a new lifestyle that I never thought I would enjoy as much as I do. Riding my bike to and from class, to grab coffee, and to eat has become one of the biggest pleasures throughout my day. It gives me an excuse to get up and move, which is invaluable in today's day and age where we are incentivized to just stay in, lounge, and consume (online shopping, food delivery, home entertainment). For people in similar situations to us, biking is a totally reasonable alternative.
<br><br>

I say this now, but almost the entire quarter I have been vocalizing how impractical it would be for a large portion of Americans who commute thousands of miles a year to get to work. It just didn't seem practical or safe to expect it from so many people. But Ken's suggestion of renovated bike lanes and bikes fitted with electric motors has opened up so many possibilities. 28 miles an hour is more than fast enough to get you where you need to go, and besides, you're normally lucky to be driving a quarter of that speed in rush hour traffic. And with the change in street layouts and the inclusion of protected, dedicated bicycle lanes, I think many Americans would start to make the switch. 
<br><br>

This lecture has left me feeling the most hopeful so far, and with elections coming up extremely fast I can't wait to see what changes are going to be implemented.

I also think that a transition to biking is achievable through bike lanes and electric bikes. Living in Santa Barbara has also shown me how easy and convenient biking can be, and I wish it was the same everywhere else. I honestly hate driving, and biking can sometimes be just as fast as sitting in traffic. It is so convenient to wake up, bike to class, and then bike home.
<br><br>
Voting in local elections is definitely the way to make these kind of changes which will encourage more people to also stop driving, or at least drive less often.

Like you, I grew up near Los Angeles as well, so i understand the feeling of uncertainty without a car. Often friends and family asked when I was getting a car, and frankly the idea of a car was exciting. I spent so much money on uber and lyft, so the idea of owning a car appeared liberating, and overall a way to make my life more efficient. However, living here in Santa Barbara has completely changed my perspective. I don’t own a bike, so I either walk or take the bus, but i have been considering getting a bike soon. I agree with Ken 100 percent about road infrastructure. Back home, “bike lanes” are also a white line separating traffic from bikes, so i can understand the obvious danger that cyclists face on the road, and why it’s necessary to make political decisions that benefit the people directly. With better roads and bike lanes, less people would be fearful of getting rammed by a car and killed. I think voting is super important because it allows us to elect those who will make decisions that benefit us into power.

Something that Ken mentioned in this video especially stuck out to me which was that to get issues noticed and addressed, you must be a thorn in the side of politicians through activism. I'm currently working with CALPIRG which is a public interest research group here at UCSB that works to tackle important issues that regard promoting civic engagement, and protecting the environment. One of CALPIRG's campaigns that I'm working on now is to ban fracking and the main tactic of this campaign is to run high visibility events to capture governor Gavin Newsom's attention in order to champion him to be a leader on this issue and ban fracking in California. We aim to show him that there's a large coalition behind this issue and that the dangers of fracking matter to us as students, and as citizens of both California and the United States. At the end of week nine, we'll actually be holding a UC-Wide human oil spill where across the UC's, students will lay down in busy parts of campus dressed in black in order to bring attention to the environmental and public health dangers that fracking causes. This will be accompanied by speeches made by student leaders and action tables where you will be able to help us grab Newsom's attention through writing a tweet or a letter. This type of activism is, as Ken stated, extremely important when trying to solve these issues. Voting is important because we can elect leaders we trust to take these issues seriously, then attention must be brought to these issues so we can champion these leaders to make the change we are fighting for.

After watching the lecture video, it has become very obvious to me that active political participation through the form of voting and environmental activism should also be taken into consideration when we discuss the ways to mitigate the climate crisis. I think a lot of people may have overlooked the importance of political activism and participation and voting, including myself because I used to not see the point or purpose behind voting. I used to think that my mere vote probably would not have changed anything in the world and around me because afterall it is only one vote and it does not mean much. However, I failed to see that if there are others who have the same votes as mine and collectively these many votes can cause a difference if not in our world but at least in my local area. This lecture video again reaffirmed the values behind the action of voting and political participation because voting is one of the most effective ways for our voices to be heard by the government officials as we are making our demands and will celar to the government officials through our voting results. 
<br><br>


When Ken mentioned in the video that only doing personal actions such as forgoing the car and switching to a largely plant-based diet would not be enough to remediate climate change because ultimately the elephant in the room is fracking and fossil fuel use and extraction contributing two-thirds of the carbon emission into the atmosphere. Abandoning the practice of fracking of fossil fuels by the fossil fuel companies is way beyond our individual powers, and when it comes to such a critical and influential issue like hydraulic fracking, voting is the way to go for us ordinary citizens. Since we do not have the power to persuade and prevent the companies from practicing fracking, we need to utilize the power of the voting ballot in our hands and vote for government officials and leaders who oppose such practices and truly take the concerns and wishes of their voters to heart. This way, we can reduce the practice of fracking and fossil fuel extraction by the fossil fuel companies because the elected government leaders and officials have the power to pass laws and legislations that the companies have to abide by. These laws and legislations can in turn restrict the practice of hydraulic fracking thus reducing and limiting the amount of carbon emission into the atmosphere from fossil fuel companies. 

<br><br>

The Copenhagen example brought up during the lecture video further proves the power of the people and their political participation through voting as well as environmental activism such as protests and demonstrations. This example shows that the government can take environmentally-friendly measures and people’s votes and activism can make a difference in the world, but the only problem is whether the government and the people are willing to commit to such actions. 

<br><br>

Voting and activism are two vital ways for people to make their voices and demands heard by the government, and in this case we should follow these two approaches in order to raise awareness on climate change and to attract government attention on the issue of climate crisis. When we have gathered enough momentum in society, the government will need to follow through and listen to the requests of its citizens and actually take part in the global movement to mitigate climate crisis. We need to constantly keep in mind that climate change is no joke and is a pressing serious issue faced by the entire globe, and with that in mind we should get out to vote and participate in environmental activism movements to show our determination to save our environment by first and foremost, demanding to reduce fracking and the subsequent large amount of carbon emission from the practice of fracking by the fossil fuel companies. We should all be environmental activists.

Ken, I really enjoyed the way you weaved the three key concepts of personal action, climate activism, and political action together.  You showed me that all of them play an integral role in reversing the Climate Crisis.  in my opinion, the most important action you can do is vote because I don't think that a major change can be made in the Climate Crisis without laws the prohibit or tax anything that puts Carbon into the air.  And the only way for that to happen is to vote for people that support the reduction of Carbon in the atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong personal action is great, but the majority of the people in the United States would not take personal action on their own accord.  They need to be motivated by money or by a law that makes public transport, meat-free lifestyle the easy way.  Not to mention it is huge for us to vote for people that support the Green New Deal as that will show the government what the people want.  The more that vote the bigger the change.  I am so glad that you had someone come in and have everyone sign up to vote because it truly is so important in changing our Carbon emissions.  I am planning on voting for Bernie Sanders as he supports the Green New Deal and sees the Climate Crisis as a serious issue.

I’ll admit, after watching this lecture video, I began to reconsider my intention on switching to a pseudo-vegetarian or vegan diet, among other lifestyle changes. Even if everyone went vegan, it wouldn’t be enough. My automatic thought is then, why should I do it? But after finishing the video, I returned to my initial viewpoint in which I understand that every small action makes a difference.
<br><br>


Sure, it’ll be tough cutting out meat from my diet. Swearing to bike or take public transportation when I want to get around even when it’s unsafe or not prevalent where I live. Paying extra attention to every product to make sure its production and ingredients are at least somewhat considerate of the planet. But I think it’s really more about the mindset that all these lifestyle changes will put me in. If I am conscious about the way I eat, travel, etc., it will provide me with a daily motivation to become or better myself as a climate activist. 
<br><br>


I don’t think it’s too much to ask for everyone to do a little research before they vote for the people they want in government—the people that have control over how they live their lives. And to spend a little more time pushing their family members and friends to vote for the right people isn’t a chore either. This is our world and our future, and every little thing counts. Every vote, every meal, every morning commute. As Ken said, it’s our job to act upon the knowledge we now have and turn that knowledge into power.

I agree with you on many of your points. I have always been one of those people who could never understand how people could become vegetarian or vegan. However, during my time at college, I can't eat meat at the dining commons due to religious reasons, and I find that I don't really feel like I'm missing out. The food is still delicious and fulfilling. Sure, there are times where I do wish I had meat, but for the most part, I'm fine, and I feel like if everyone could cut meat out for a significant portion of their lives (not entirely, if you find that hard to do), it wouldn't be that bad, especially if you start off slowly.
<br><br>

As for taking public transportation, I think I am already comfortable with that. Many times in high school I would need to get to places and did not have anyone to drive me, so I would either walk or I would take the bus, and neither of those ever failed me.
<br><br>

Lastly, I agree that it is important to be aware of who and what you are voting for. Instead of attacking someone whose political views are not in line with yours, I encourage having healthy debates on issues in order to figure out what your true opinion on things is. Most people will be pushed away if all you do is attack them, but will more likely listen to you if you are more respectful.


<br><hr>
I agree that personal action is still important for climate activism, but I have come to believe that in a different way than every difference matters. Since as Ken put it, stopping fracking and coal/oil use is the real big goal (being ⅔ of climate emissions and everything else only being chipping away and not making major progress towards solving the climate crisis), and the only way to be able to achieve this will have to be through government action. To break the the status quo and cause government action it will be necessary for people to become climate activists and use their vote to cause meaningful change. Though personal action does not cause politicians to ban fracking it is still important because for example if you didn’t and lived a lifestyle that caused a great deal of carbon emissions you essentially would stop actually caring for the environment and become a hypocrite (which climate skeptics would love to point out to discredit you as a climate activist), but not even in respect to being a hypocrite I don’t think it would be really possible for someone to be holy committed in climate change and wish to solve the issue if they themselves don’t put mental energy towards not being part of the problem themselves.
<br><hr>


I agree that I have always contemplated switching to a meat-free diet and wonder, would my individual diet change really make a difference? But after this class, I have come to realize that yes it very much would make a difference. I am sure that I am just one of many people that thought: oh I as an individual would not make any real impact, so why bother making the change? But that mindset is very harmful because instead of it just causes all of us to be inactive in truly making a difference in the fight against climate change. I now understand we all need to make personal changes in our lifestyles to fully stand a chance against the climate crisis. 
 <br><br>
    Being politically active and conscious of the people we are voting for in office is crucial if we really want to make big changes in the way we deal with the climate crisis. Yes, our personal actions matter very much, but even if we all make individual changes we still need to work collectively to make an even larger difference. We see how collective action worked so efficiently in the Copenhagen bike infrastructure as Ken mentioned in the video. Now if we in the U.S. could do that as well and take it to the political level too I am sure we can make an enormous difference.  But first, we need to elect people in office who care about implementing climate change policies- people who keep us and the whole planet in mind.

<br><hr>
I agree with how even if everyone went vegan, it wouldn't be enough, we need to make more changes to how we as a country and  a world do things to fix the climate. I think its good to encourage people to make small changes at first, then work on slowly making larger changes. An example could be cutting down little by little on meat consumption every week, or riding your bike or the bus to work or school at least once or twice a week. A large part we can do to help is educate, before this class I didn't know a lot about how climate change is dealt with in the government and if we educate the people about the right things, we can work towards change.

<br><hr>
I strongly agree with what you have commented on in the lecture video. Although some personal action might not influence the world immediately, we need to belive that our world will be better if more and more take collective actions together. Especially, I like your comment" This is our world and our future". It demonstrates that we need to care about ourselves and consider our bright future by taking actions,

I really liked that Ken mentioned the interconnectedness of personal action, activism, and political change. Taking personal actions every day to fight against climate change can encourage you to become a climate activist, and activism has been shown to actually be able to result in political change. It was a little discouraging to hear that even if the entire world went vegan, that would still not reduce carbon emissions enough to save the environment, but it is crucial to put that into perspective-- if the entire world cared enough to go vegan, then they would also care enough to push for governmental changes that can reduce fracking. Since fracking is responsible for 2/3 of emissions in the United States, this would be huge. 
 <br><br>

Especially as major elections are going on, it is so important to remember that voting can become a major solution if enough people vote intelligently. A lot of people do not feel that there is enough incentive to vote, so the fact that our voting is the biggest and easiest thing we can do to help combat climate change should be spread to a wider audience.
 <br><br>

I think it is really inspiring to see a city like Copenhagen making so many huge strides in sustainability. In just a few decades, the people were able to get very safe bike paths through bottom up change through demanding these changes on a local level, then moving farther up the totem pole. I find it strange that a city like Santa Barbara, which often flaunts being a leader in climate activism, does not have safer bike paths as alternatives to automobiles.

I also liked that Ken mentioned the interconnectedness of personal action, activism, and political change. I do also see why fracking is the issue that we need to raise awareness about.  I like that mention that with elections coming about we should vote intelligently. As we are currently taking this course and have gained knowledge on these issues, we should take action. I too was surprised that Santa Barbara hasn’t constructed better bike paths, but it all begins at a local level. There seems to be other things that are put first in matter of importance and I am starting to think it has to do with the major use of automobiles in the city.

Yes, for sure, personally action may be effective to protect the environment. I can change my diet to plant-based and ride the bicycle instead of car. But as a permanent president, I am not eligible to vote, which the professor mentions in the video, as an important action about being politically active. That one thing I cannot take action about, sadly. And for transportation, I personally like riding bicycle since it is more relaxing and environmental-friendly than driving a car. Unfortunately, my knee is not getting well for several years. So, it is nearly impossible for me to ride a bicycle. I usually walk or take the bus for most of the time even though taking the car saving lots of the time. However, in the California, you barely live without a car. Bus and walk cannot do anything, so I think developing the public transportation is very necessary if we are going to transfer to the renewable energy generation. Personally action is important, but government’s action is also significant for protecting the planet.

I enjoyed this week's lecture video due to the fact that it shed a new light on the ways that we as an individual can make a difference. I usually feel like most of the solutions we talk about can only be achieved with mass participation, but this video showed me that a single individual really can change the world for the better. I like to think of this like a ripple effect: if some people feel that they can create change with their own actions, then eventually everybody will join in, and we can all make a difference.
 <br><br>
I also felt like this video was extremely relevant to the current political climate that we live in today. There are too many teenagers that do not vote, and it needs to change. We will never be able to make the changes we need to help save the planet if we do not put people in office who also care about the climate crisis. It is a little sad that so many politicians do not believe climate change is real, but, unfortunately, this is our reality. As Ken mentioned, one of the best ways to combat this problem is to vote for people who will fight for out planet.
 <br><br>
Hearing about Copenhagen gave me hope that people around the world will take action. It is so inspiring to hear that 62 percent of people in Copenhagen bike to work or school. It makes me feel that if they can do it, we can too. The only difference between them and us, is that they have much better bike lanes than we do. I completely agree with Ken. If the United States improved the bike lanes, a great deal more people would bike to work instead of drive. I have heard countless stories about bikers who have been hit or almost hit by cars, and frankly, I have heard way too many of them. Not only will this change help save our environment, but it will also save lives.

I also enjoyed watching this lecture, especially after reading and watching the videos on the Green New Deal I felt a little bit cynical about it, but voting and activism are two really strong ways to combat the deniers and climate change. The green new deal made me think, "How could we possibly do this?" but maybe if we just voted for the right people, and there has to be right people out there then maybe we can combat the deniers. Maybe they could implement the green new deal. I know that before there was a trend of youth not voting, but I hope with the outcome of last elections, more youth will start to vote and believe their vote means something.


<br><hr>
I completely agree, I really like how this video combined individual action with mass activism. I agree that we must be the change we want to see in the world, while also realizing that most people won’t change voluntarily. Because of this sad reality, we must vote for politicians who will make a change. More teenagers need to exercise their right to vote, voting for politicians who are environmentally friendly. While sweeping reform seems unrealistic, small changes such as better bike lanes, really can make a difference. Copenhagen gives me hope, as 62% of their population commutes by bike. I completely agree that if they can do it, we can too. If towns and cities across America made changes in biking infrastructure, we can drastically reduce emissions. With this, if electric bikes became more popular, these ideas would be more feasible. 
  <br><br>

I believe that if we really want to make a change, we must combine political activism with individual change. While just switching to a plant-based diet won’t compensate for the amount of methane produced in fracking, it does make a difference. We all have the ability to encourage people to vote and to be educated about it. If we all voted for a green politician, we could save billions of pounds of CO2 emissions. Voting is one of the easiest and best ways to reform our country.

I liked the realistic and practical approach that Ken took in the start of this video. He points out that while it may be ideal for everyone on the planet to cut out meat, gas, or oil, it simply is not realistic. We cannot depend on everyone on the planet to take such individual impacts and it is important to realize that when crafting an effective solution for climate change. 

  <br><br>

Ken also addresses the importance of voting (one of the most important individual actions) in trying to curb the climate crisis. This has become increasingly important, especially with the current Presidential election right around the corner. One one side, our current President has pulled out of the Paris Accord and has repeatedly belittled the importance of climate change. On the other, we have a stage full of candidates who support different types of plans to help move towards a cleaner environment. The effect of voting is seen clearly in this situation - the next President we elect will dictate how our country progresses (or does not progress) in helping slow down climate change.
  <br><br>


Commitment to change requires a foundation for change. It is difficult to expect people to shift to alternatives when the world is simply not setup to handle the alternative. As seen with the example of bikes, in most places cycling along side roads is both dangerous and overlooked. In order to transition from cars to bicycles, the first step is to actually provide the infrastructure - this means adding protected bike lanes, building bikes lanes on significantly used streets, and promoting efficient bicycles such as the Pedalic to the public.




</p><hr>



<p>
When watching this talk, I truly making the most of Ken's story of Copenhagen's effective move from transportation via autos to bicycles, since I feel that it was an extraordinary case of how we can utilize our own behavior and activism to in the end make political change that benefits the atmosphere. Living in America, I come to acknowledge increasingly more every day how solid of a grasp huge organizations have in molding the general public we live in and the status quo expended. I think one about the reasons why Americans feel vanquished by the atmosphere emergency is on the grounds that they question the intensity of their voice. A considerable lot of us have supportive expectations, we simply need to trust in our own training and advance the qualities that will profit networks and the planet. This will alarm lawmakers who need our votes. 

  <br><br>

Catching wind of Copenhagen gave me trust that individuals around the globe will make a move. It is so rousing to hear that 62 percent of individuals in Copenhagen bicycle to work or school. It causes me to feel that in the event that they can do it, we can as well. The main distinction among them and us, is that they have more bike paths we do. I totally concur with Ken. In the event that the United States improved the bicycle paths, significantly more individuals would bicycle to work rather than drive. I have heard incalculable tales about bikers who have been hit or nearly hit via vehicles, and in all honesty, I have heard such a large number of them. Not exclusively will this change help spare our condition, yet it will likewise spare lives.

I agree that Copenhagen was a great example of how to create a positive change to help the environment. Like you mentioned, it is scary though because too many people many people have died. That was always my biggest fear being a prominent biker. I'd bike everywhere since I never had a car, but I was always scared of being hit by a car. This is why it is important to have infrastructure in place that supports less emission. In the case of Copenhagen, this is done with bike paths that our distinguishable on a street or on their own path. This could be done with other transportation like making trains more accessible to help get more people off of cars. If the government can continue to take steps in order to promote green habits through things like bike paths, carbon taxes, rise of beef cost, and ect, more and more people will be equipped to take personal changes in their lives. This means that it will take a joint effort from those in charge as well as an effort from all of us in our daily lives to save the earth.

I completely agree that Copenhagen is one of the best, most inspiring examples of real change being made in support of the well-being of the environment. I definitely can see your point in saying many Americans feel as though they don't have a voice, as I have definitely felt that way in the past. As a young person, I think its really easy to get trapped in that mindset as you see the world being controlled by people generations above you with a very different perspective. I've also found that young people are often seen as having illegitimate arguments or having a lack of understanding on how the world works. I really admire Ken's teachings, as well as others, because they encourage our generation to take action instead of being afraid. With the mindset that we are capable of creating change, we can hopefully follow similar plans of action as Copenhagen.

I live in LA where cars have literally taken up our environment. It is always full of traffic with awful or enraged drivers which make it unsafe for individuals to ride a bike. The bike lanes are little to non-existent back in my hometown. When I moved to UCSB for college, I was quite shocked to see such amazing bike lanes everywhere I looked. I believe that going to college has impacted individuals' decision on transitioning to a bike which is way greener for our environment. Personal action is the first step in helping our environment. If we all make a personal effort to change our lifestyles, such as, biking, not eating meat, minimalism, voting and the use of solar panels, can have a great impact in the long run. I think UCSB also has an amazing environmental department in educating the public and encouraging individuals to make these changes. Not only did I learn about materialistic changes I can make, I now understand how important it is to vote and obtain more factual evidence and do more research when topics such as The Green New Deal come up. Individuals should really take advantage of the value of voting because it can truly make a change

What matters more? That is a tough question to ask considering how important each one of these things are in order to deal with climate change. BUt personal action and climate activism can go hand in hand, so when becoming politically active it allows you to bring people together over a cause. After watching Ken’s lecture video, I strongly believe that being politically active is the most important way to deal with climate change.  When I first voted, I am guilty to say that I wish i researched more on the topics that I was voting on. This helps me realize that the information out there on topics like that of climate change needs to be spread in order for people like me who are uninformed to use our votes wisely. The way our political system is set up in the United States makes it so that political activism is the only main way that we can get our voices heard. To get involved in politics, and to even have to say or think about that word makes people cautious of how involved they want to get. I liked listening about how Copenhagen and their government was put into action because local political activists were able to get their government to listen to them. This goes to show that we do need to be local so that our state and nation can be fully involved in understanding and dealing with climate change.

I like this idea, that the most powerful way to be involved in mitigating effects of climate change is political activism. Recently, in preparation for the 2020 primaries I have been most inclined towards candidates who are supportive of carbon reducing practices. Ken really makes it apparent that politicians have significant power, whether it be legislative or otherwise. Voting for elected officials that reflect your beliefs is a really powerful process that is supposed to bring about lots of positive change. Tom Steyer is the only candidate that supports implementing a cap and trade program that aims to reduce carbon emissions. Oil tycoons and greedy business owners forget you can only exploit the earth and its inhabitants for so long until the Earth begins to fight back. There are no dollars to be accumulated or luxuries to be had if our world is on the brink of being poisoned to death. Individual laypeople have very little influence over major business practices. But besides being conscious about our consuming habits, the best way to support a positive American future, is to vote your conscience and support politicians who vow to mitigate issues at hand. It is really nice to know this power lies within us but it is also a major reminder that voting citizens have an obligation to vote, speak for their community and shape the world around them.

After watching the video, I have more insights into the benefits of riding bikes. As Ken mentioned in the video, there are many pros of riding bikes: no worries about traffic and doing good to our bodies. And most importantly, it reduces the emission of greenhouse gas. When I first came to UCSB, I was kind of surprised by the biking paths and skateboard paths. Because in the city that I born and grew up, there is no bike paths. It is not because how much people in my city like to drive, but the geographic feature of the city. My city had a nickname called the Mountain City, so it is pretty hard to ride bikes there. Yet every time I walk on campus worrying about being murdered by bikes, I think I still like the environmental friendly campus. I never doubt that the goods bikes do to our environment. After I moved out of IV, I had to drive to school every day, which brought up more financial burdens. I had to pay for the gasoline, the parking fee and the large amount of registration fee every year. Those are quite an amount. And sometimes I missed the days when I walk or bike to school. It is not only money-saving but also energy-saving.

After watching the lecture video, “Personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active? Which matters more?”, I was impressed with Copanhagens ability to shift transportation from cars to bikes. I strongly believe that our society needs to invest in better public transportation, whether that’s bikes or buses. There are billions of people in this world trying to get to different places, eventually we will run out of places to put cars. Not only will we run out of space for everyone to drive cars, but it will be extremely harmful to the environment. Most of the time only one or two people are in a car, but if people took the bus instead there would be less cars on the road since not everyone needs to drive. If the country invests in better public transportation, more and more people will use the bus because there will no longer be a need to drive a car. As of right now, buses and other forms of public transportation are not very reliable, which is why people rely on their cars a lot more instead of the bus. The busing system does not work very well here around UCSB, but it is still way better than what I have seen back at home. For the most part there’s a bus that passes by almost every ten minutes in front of Santa Catalina dorms, which makes it super convenient to take the bus to class. If there were no buses more students would rely on their cars to take them to school, which would be way worse for the environment. If more cities had transportation like we do here or even better public transportation, I believe there would be less cars on the road.

It is important to know that, although a plant based diet will greatly reduce CO2 emissions, more than 28% of CO2 and Methane is produced by transportation. The increase in popularity of bikes but the fact is that cities are not built for bikes to be the number one transporter. I once saw an image about how much space would be made if we took out all the space for cars (freeways, streets, parking structures) and there was a significant amount of land. However, it is difficult for many people to ride their bikes because of how dangerous it is, as you had mentioned. When I was little, I was not allowed to ride my bike alone anywhere in fear that I would either get hurt or kidnapped. Because of this, I got used to driving everywhere. I haven’t even been on a bus, besides a school bus, before this year. However, the switch from driving to biking has been a lot less stressful than driving. Growing up in LA county, I have experienced a lot of traffic, including one 12 hour car ride from Merced to Long Beach (usually about a 4 hour drive) during the winter because the mountains were closed. This is why governments need to implement better and safer bike lanes. Ken has also mentioned the importance of voting. I believe that it is very important to stress that because so many people have an idea that their vote doesn’t matter, which discourages the voters from voting. People also need to vote more in local elections to make a bigger impact.

All personal activism, climate activism, and politically active are all very important, as one person can make a big difference.

The most important piece of information I took from this lecture video was that the excuse we can't make the shift from cars to bikes is no longer valid. Hearing Copenhagen has successfully made the transformation as almost two-thirds of people commute makes the rest of the world not only gives a hopeful outlook on changing our bike current situation but it leaves the question of what we are waiting for. Ken mentions several upsides to riding a bike that include never experiencing traffic and the positive effects it has on your body.  I remember when I first arrived at UCSB I initially rejected the idea of riding a bike as I had never used one in my daily life before. Within two weeks I quickly understood how unrealistic that was here. My friends and family back home still find it insane that I joined in on this culture but I really just followed the crowd like they do back home with driving cars. While I feel incredibly safe riding a bike on campus, heading anywhere else seems so unsafe I do not plan on trying it. It feels like a major setback when even a progressive city like Santa Barbara experiences tragedies like the four killed in Modoc. Besides the fact of climate change, this alone should push politicians to take the idea of creating a safer method of transportation to those who use bikes for whatever reason more seriously. It is unreal to me that biking is still not used widely in this country when it is better than cars personally and globally. Everyone has a responsibility at this point to ensure our collective home does not burn and the easiest way to do is by voting. The true power behind voting never hit me until I took this class and now I feel a lot better knowing many people on this campus constantly push that upon students. It has been proven by Copenhagen, this idea of mass bike usage is possible when you keep the public properly informed.

I agree with your opinions on the biking issues! It is so fascinating seeing how other countries and tows are integrating bicycles just like UCSB does today. Biking genuinely is more economically good and environmentally good for everyone who partakes in that kind of commuting. I do understand that it is not more convenient at times for a lot of people but transportation by bike and public transportation goes hand in hand with another solution to the climate crisis... moving to cities rather than suburbs. 
  <br><br>
Indeed, we can make personal adjustments to our own behaviors and actions to make little, tiny differences in the CO2 emissions, but how much more ca we do with a powerful pull in the political realm? A LOT MORE!!!!! We need to get up and vote so that we can start making a difference in emissions that will actually be noted rather than just passed by millions of people everyday.

When thinking about Ken’s questions, about the roles of personal action, activism, and political activism, they all hold a huge weight and are all important. However, when thinking about which one has much more of an impact, I believe that political activism has the most weight of all three of these roles. Being able to get people into power that mirror the ideals in order to help the climate crisis will greatly help place into effect laws or suggestions and have it implemented into the daily life of many hundreds of Americans. Plus, having it become a law will also help set an example for other countries who want to do the same thing but haven’t done it yet. However, personal action is also extremely important as there are many things that it can help with. Taking your own actions into account and trying to help with the climate crisis, it will help other people try and fix their actions if they see other people around them doing things to help the situation. Activism is the last but not the least important thing cause there has to be a group of people that help change the way that things are, and that push and help others that want to help change things for the better.

I agree that political activism is the most important out of the three. It certainly sets the tone. To me, I think it starts locally. If people go to the mayor and state assemblies, it can grow into something that is long term instead of a trend. Local politics is huge because it affects our day-to-day. Having a president believe in climate change would be a huge help but right now we have to build with what we have. Consolidating power from the ground up will go a long way. Personal actions can be helpful as well. I am sure people in neighborhoods will take notice and may even follow our example.

After watching the video, “Personal Action, climate activism, or being politically active. Which matters more?”, I see the power of politics in different aspects. Ken said that even all the people have large plant-based diet instead of eating beef, it is still inadequate compare to the fracking problems. It is ironic to see that some politicians still support the fracking development even he is under the name of “mitigating the climate change” So, what things can normal individuals like us can do to protect our home. Voting is the most practical thing we can do, even is the easiest thing we can do. To solve CO2 and methane problems, using eco-friendly transportation and provide clean, energy-sufficiency public transportation is something individual and government can do. For example, voting for bicycle lanes is critical for decreasing greenhouse emission in the US. In Copenhagen, it is amazing to hear about two-thirds people commute by bike in this small city. The specialized bicycle lanes can also ensure the safety of riders. Moreover, it brings a reduction of astonishing 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 emission per year. In UCSB, I usually commute by walking. Though there are bicycle lanes in our campus, it is too narrow, and the speed of riders is too fast. I often see the bike accidents on the road. Sometimes, it even affects pedestrians’ safety. So creating safe bicycle lanes works well for reducing emissions.
  <br><br>
To sum up, the lecture video gives me some new ideas about how our votes can support some green changes of climate. At the same time, it provides several goals for individual, climate activists, and political activists to achieve.

Before watching this video, I had no idea about Mark Ruffalo being a climate activist. I wonder why it is not mentioned much. Since most of this lecture revolved around bike usage, it reminded me of one of the teachers at my high school. He used to bike it to school everyday, and everyone would talk about him. I initially thought he did it for health reasons, but now I think he may have done it for environmental reasons. I never had him as a teacher, but he was often talked about, and I once actually saw him come into campus with his bike. I wish I could have talked to him (according to people who actually got to have him as a teacher, it seemed like he actually cared about the students and enjoyed engaging with them.) I think he could have taught me a lot. Unfortunately, for some reason the high school I went to didn't offer Earth Science so I was not aware of many of the issues we have covered in this class until I actually got to college.
  <br><br>
I really liked the ending of this video, its nice to be reminded of the things we are allowed to do that can set us in the right direction.

I also had a teacher in high school who would always bike to school. He lived nearby and I assumed that was the reason but now this also makes sense. I remember so many other selfish people who live a street from the school and would still choose to drive. Many people do see people who bike to their job or school as uncool and ‘poor’. We need to get rid of what mindset. Here at UCSB, we do not feel like that because the campus was made for bikes and it is so much easier to get around. I love it because I bike to my job, to my classes and get some exercise in. Back home, biking is so dangerous outside the residential streets because drivers do not care for the cyclists and will purposely try to hit them. 
  <br><br>

It was a little discouraging to hear that even if every individual went vegan or stopped driving cars, the climate crisis would continue as a major issue. It can make a significant change but the real change needs to happen at a government level for them to implement legislation. Most people around the world will not want to give up their luxurious lifestyle of eating meat, buying unnecessary stuff and traveling on planes or cars. Voting was introduced as the most effective way to create change. We need to elect people who are pro-environment and will implement policies necessary. Cultural change is also necessary because consuming meat and owning a car is what is ́ 'cool’ and popular.

After watching this video, I know that every little step we take to protect the environment it all has its value. I think we can do some things to slow down the speed of climate change. First, we can save energy by close the light during the night. I saw a lot of places they open the light even they are closed. In my high school’s residential hall, we close the light at 12:00 pm and open at 5:30 am. I think this is a good way to save energy. Second, take bus or ride bike to college. Change our way of taking transportation is also a good way to help to change the climate crisis. Third, we can reduce food waste. There are still some poor areas of the world experiencing starvation. Maybe we can do something to help them. 
  <br><br>
But the most important thing is it cannot have a huge impact to solve the climate crisis by a person. We need the government’s and public’s power. Now the government doesn’t want to admit climate change, they said it’s a hoax because put money to save the climate will influence the interest and will cost a lot. People can change the situation by voting. 
  <br><br>
After all, take action to save our planet, even its small, it will have an impact.

I strongly agree with you. I live in Tropicana Del Norte, one of the school dorms near the campus. And I see the lights in the aisles every night, until morning. I understand that this might be for the safety of people walking in late night, but it’s not really necessary to turn on so many lights the whole night. Also these lights kind of interfere with my sleep because they are so bright. This happens in the stores too, on the street. 

  <br><br>

Also, I think personal actions are simply not enough. As a person, we don’t have that much power to publicize our thought or action, and only through politics, the idea of climate crisis could be learned and practiced everyday, massively.

While I found this video informational and helpful, I still feel things we do on an individual scale to cut back on carbon emissions is nowhere near as effective as mass changes like legislation. That is where real change occurs in my opinion. Also, while Ken’s idea of making biking more feasible would be a good way to combat carbon emissions, I still feel like in the US many people would still drive.

I actually liked the way that Ken addressed the topic of voting as the number one thing we can do to help as of right now. He still encourages us to be more conscious of what we eat, our air travels, transportation, and other small things, but through this video, he stresses that voting is the most important. No matter how much we talk about the small changes we can make, in reality, people all around the world who will actually make these changes will constitute a very small percentage. Thus, instead of starting small, like how we do with most of our problems, we need to start big by tackling the foundation of our government. Honestly, I am very optimistic about the near future, as I see more college students and young adults become active in politics and preach what they believe is right.
  <br><br>
I totally agree with you that legislation if where real change will occur. Hopefully when we start making progress, people will realize the importance of saving the climate.


<br><hr>
I agree. Individual action is important, don't get me wrong. However, without serious action on the government's part, we can't solve this. While debating this with someone in one of my ES classes, they brought up the civil rights movement, and how action came from the top down. This is true. However, change really took place once the government, admittedly under pressure from civil rights groups, enacted sweeping legislation. The point of this example is that you will never get 100% support for a cause. Civil rights certainly didn't, and neither will environmentalism. We need to use the government to control the crisis whether or not every single person agrees. We don't have enough time for them all to get on board.

After watching the lecture, I felt like I could do something personally in order to stop the climate change and save our planet. First of all, it is important to save energy use in our daily life and waste less food. Besides, more importantly, we get the right to vote. Even though I do not have American nationality, I can encourage my American classmates to vote. Also, I can advertise to others about what is happening on our planet. I can educate my parents as well to save energy, drive less cars, and eat plant-based diet. These actions are more pragmatic compared to the Green New Deal. Because these things are what we can do immediately and they can be applied easily. If everyone pays a little bit effort to protect our environment, I believe it will make a big difference collectively. Probably, the effect would be similar to the result of the Green New Deal.

I too felt empowered to make change after watching this lecture. Learning about the climate crisis can certainly be a dreary thing, especially when so many factors are out of your control. By remembering what you can do, both in terms of political power and personal lifestyle, and remembering that many just like you  are also making their contribution to help the planet (such as the amazing strides in Copenhagen talked about by Ken), the dreariness is a little less dreadful. 
  <br><br>
I found it interesting that, as Ken explained, sometimes large  impacts on the climate can come about simply by making better choices more convenient. Whether this means more vegan options available in restaurants and supermarkets, safer and more usable bike lanes, or raised fuel prices, there are many ways to nudge consumers in the right direction that I believe our country should be taking advantage of.

Watching Ken’s lecture, I enjoyed the informative nature of the video but was once again left feeling the same sense of dread. Like once again the problem is worse than I originally thought and still, nobody cares enough so my generation will be the one to deal with it. Simple changes like going vegan, biking, and switching to solar are not good enough to deal with the extent of the crisis and still, there is no sign that mass amounts of people will even make those changes. I’m guilty of that as I don’t choose to go vegan even though it's better for me and the planet. Methane is horrible for the atmosphere, its 34 times more powerful than CO2 and only 28% of those emissions come from meat production. The methane released by fracking is so much that if everyone stops eating meat it would only account for about ⅓ of methane emission. That just furthers the problem and I think Ken is right when he says that we need to address the “800 lb gorilla in the room.” I appreciate the fact that Ken stays true to his environmental message and commutes using a bike. I’m sure that its a mission, but that’s the way to lead by example. I don’t know who, but someone said, “Be the change you wish to see in the world.” The people of Copenhagen, Mark Ruffalo, Greta Thornburg are inspiring because they are humans like me who have responsibilities and commitments, but they make climate conservation a real priority. As much as I hate it, we need people to understand the climate crisis and take collective action. As the youth, we are the only ones with the responsibility to make it happen and I hope we can step up to the plate.

After watching all of Ken’s lectures up to this week, I was inclined to take more individual action to consider how I might reduce my carbon footprint now and in the future. Then, watching the beginning of his lecture for this week and hearing about the problems with hydraulic fracking that is funded by big corporations and supported by our own legislators, I was struck by this overwhelming sense of, once again, being too insignificant to make an actual change. It seems as if, no matter what lifestyle changes I choose to make, it will not matter if it is not influencing the power of the fossil fuel industry and, most importantly, our policymakers. 
  <br><br>


When Ken began to explain that political activism through voting is the simplest yet most effective way that we can ignite change, I began to understand why he explained that our own choices are not enough. We often underestimate the power of our votes, especially at the local level. As in the example of Copenhagen that Ken discusses, change in the city’s infrastructure to promote bicyclists’ safety came from bottom-up environmental activism. I especially like the intention of Operation White Crosses because I saw it as a physical representation of the issue that likely ignited riled, angry responses in support of new policies. If every student on our campus were to do the same by casting educated votes in Santa Barbara and Goleta for representatives in favor of environmental legislation and the Green New Deal, we could begin to make large-scale change. Engaging in conversation with candidates running for office or even with friends and family on the topic of climate change action is also a great way to spark political activism outside the polls.

I totally agree with how you felt when watching this video. Previously, when watching one of Ken’s lectures about what we can do to mitigate the climate crisis in 5 easy steps, I felt somewhat optimistic that if most people try to follow some of these steps, we can help fix the climate crisis. But, after I began watching this lecture, I felt more pessimistic about the climate crisis, feeling like nothing I ever do will ever make a difference. I do think this is the wrong way looking at the issue. We need to see (as you said) that our own personal actions can have major impacts on the environment, and the biggest action we can do is voting. We need to vote on the local level all the way to the federal level. I feel like most people feel like the biggest and most important thing to vote for is president, which is obviously important, but voting locally is just as important in my opinion. 
  <br><br>


As we know, Santa Barbara County has one of the fastest-growing temperatures in the country because of climate change and our poor-transportation system. To change this, we need to vote in politicians that will actually want to take action and support legislation that combats climate change. For example, politicians in Santa Barbara need to vote to support changing parking lots to real estate so less people come to Santa Barbara with their cars expecting to find easy and accessible parking. If there is less parking and better transportation systems, people will use more sustainable transportation throughout Santa Barbara and not rely on their cars, which can help combat the climate crisis. Although this seems like a small step, it is a step in the right direction and the rest of the country could see how important it is and they could follow in the right direction. We need to use the amazing and innovative solutions used in Copenhagen and other sustainable cities and countries to fix our nation’s reliance on fossil fuels and help the environment. Voting is the best way to get there and supporting politicians who have the right things in mind will get us closer to solving this global issue that our country especially has perpetuated.


<br><hr>

I appreciate your agreement! As you explain, this pessimistic view will lead to inaction, when our individual actions through voting is exactly what is necessary for change. I like that you point out that people are more inclined to focus on presidential elections even though it is absolutely necessary to know who is running on local levels because this will have a more direct impact on the environment we interact with daily. You also present a perfect example in Santa Barbara of something that can be addressed that I hadn't thought of before but was also discussed in our class. Limiting parking is a good method of altering infrastructure in order to promote a more sustainable transition in our transportation, in whether we choose to advocate for improved public transportation or more safety precautions for bikers on our streets. Consequently, such change will also benefit many of us as students who rely on such methods of transportation already.

<br><hr>
In my opinion, I totally agree with you. I really love this week Ken's video, and after watching this video, it really makes me want to be a cyclist, cause this video is so inspiring. Since our campus has the atmosphere of using bike to commute, it's much easier to encourage more students to use bike to commute. Also, I never feel so sacred to be a cyclist, cause I am acting a role of protect my home, the Earth. Another important thing is that we need to know more about the candidates, so that we can vote more correctly, and choose the most suitable one who can actually do something to help our Earth. Also, limiting parking is a good method of altering infrastructure in order to promote a more sustainable transition in our transportation, in whether we choose to advocate for improved public transportation or more safety precautions for bikers on our streets

I agree. It is hard for me to grasp that some corporations in America have so much political pull, meanwhile some people basically have no say at all. Large companies have shaped society and fully influenced how politicians take on tasks. Politicians will only do what satisfies whatever group is endorsing them, whatever that might be. It seems, a lot of the time, that the majority of people are insignificant. It is true that we can change our own lifestyles as much as we want, but the real change will come from pushing the politicians and big industries to make change. 
  <br><br>

I remember hearing as I was growing up that some people weren't going to vote because their vote doesn't matter in the big scheme of things. Because I heard this so much, I grew up thinking it was true. I realize now that this small action could make a world of difference if everyone speaks up and votes for what is right and what they believe in. We need to vote for people who will take action on environmental issues. This is where things like the Green New Deal comes into play. We need to support people that support the Green New Deal and other relating topics. 
  <br><br>

The politicians who are not currently advocating for great environmental change will be swayed with the masses in order to get elected. This means the masses must show our passion and need for environmental reform and climate justice. If we show that this is a dire need for us and the planet, politicians will not ignore it, because they will lose votes, and therefore money. That is why action to activism to political reform is the perfect path to follow in changing America and the world.
<br><hr>
I completely understand your views on feeling like you are too insignificant to make any actual change.  A lot of information is constantly being thrown at us in this class and because of this, we are left to feel a lost sense of hope.  I believe that our lifestyle changes, although it may not seem like it, are one of the biggest things we can do alongside voting in order to mitigate the climate crisis.  Although I feel at times that my lifestyle changes are doing practically nothing for the environment at large, I know that I am at least doing something good for the environment that may inspire another person to do the same.  It is difficult at times to not see our efforts making a difference through real, statistical evidence.  However, I believe that through a combination of our participation in voting and progressive lifestyle changes, we are able to ignite a significant amount of change that will quickly show results. 

  <br><br>

I also agree with your statement that we often underestimate our votes because I am personally responsible for this myself.  Prior to taking this class or even coming to UCSB, I was really unaware with how voting can make such a dramatic difference in the policies that are being implemented both locally and nationally.  I think that because I never really felt as passionate about the climate change as I do after taking this class, I really did not see the value in my vote.  However, after being extensively educated on topics regarding the climate crisis, I am fully aware of the value of my vote and the great effects it will have on the environment.  Looking forward, I hope to have an even greater optimistic view about my efforts to mitigate the climate crisis even if these seem like insignificant steps in the big picture.

I think this lecture by Ken confirms my fears that change in personal behavior, albeit laudable by all means, is not enough. I agree that large-scale, radical political change (at least the political climate itself) is needed if we are to have any chance at all to stop the climate crisis from accelerating into complete madness. I can easily see how it is much easier and more practical for one person to reduce meat consumption and live with minimalist, frugal purchases, but it's almost impossible to unify that across all cultures and interest groups. After all, that's why we have raucous political disagreement and even wars on this.

  <br><br>

I'm not a citizen of the US, but I must emphasize that it's so important to exercise the power of the vote, especially given that the United States is among one of the most privileged nations in the world with a relatively democratic political system. The ability to vote for a candidate who aligns most with your values and discharge someone unfavorable from office is something that many, many, many countries would sacrifice plenty to gain. You probably can't demand everyone in a burger joint to stop eating burgers forever, but if you win in politics and contribute toward environmental-friendly legislature, that would be a much better way to advance forward.

In the lecture “Personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active. Which matters more?”, Prof. Hiltner pointed out the question that I would like to know about the most right now. my parents are actually considering buying the second car in China right now. Since they now moved to the countryside right now, they are now considering having another car to improve their efficiency because more cars means less commuting time on the road. After knowing about climate change in this course, I was suggesting them to take public transportation instead of having another car to reduce carbon emission. While I was trying my best to convince them, I was questioning myself: is this the best way? Is it really true that we are going to make a lot contribution to the atmosphere by not having another car? In the video, Prof. Hiltner told us the most effective way to vote. We should vote for the participants who suggest to address the climate change.

Up until this class, I had wanted to contribute in a positive way to mitigating the climate crisis, but I had no idea where to start. After watching Cowspiracy, it was clear to me that I needed to drastically reduce the amount of meat I ate, and try to cut it out as much as possible. However, I hadn’t thought about how little of a difference it made until hearing the statistics in this video. Half of oil and about two thirds of gas produced by the U.S. currently comes from fracking, which is the largest contributor of methane emissions. Even though meat production is still a huge portion of methane emissions, realistically, the country is never going to be 100% vegetarian, let alone the entire country. While I still think it is crucial to change my individual actions to reduce my carbon footprint as much as possible, I see now that the most important thing I can do is 1. Vote knowledgeably, and 2. Spread the knowledge I have gained through this class in order to persuade others to do the same. If I have learned anything in this class, it is that the climate crisis can only be fixed through staggering cultural changes. Cultural changes will not come about by simply not eating meat or using public transportation, but by creating a new era of environmentally conscious Americans. So instead of just eating less meat privately, I will ask people to watch Cowspiracy. Instead of just purchasing second hand, I will recommend the film True Cost to others and hopefully inspire others to do the same. And instead of just voting, I will make sure to encourage others to vote for candidates that will fight for the Green New Deal.

I agree 100% with you, this class has really taught me how to mitigate the climate crisis. Knowing that not eating meat does not make such a drastic difference really is disappointing because that is something that any individual can do. But the thing we need to change is our culture, that seems really hard to do because no one likes change. Like you said, it is still important for me to reduce my individual carbon footprint but voting is by far the best thing you can do. Voting is investing in the future generation. I see it like this, when there is a company that is starting off and if a lot of people invest in it, it would eventually become successful. Which I think is similar in voting. We need to vote (invest) for someone who is going to listen to us and listen to the environment and pass laws that will help mitigate the climate crisis ( the company). I can not wait till I go back home and inform my parents about the climate crisis. I can not wait till I tell them that they should vote for someone who is going to fight the climate crisis. We need the Green New Deal to happen so we need to vote for candidates who are willing to fight for it

I agree with you, this class has allowed me to see how I can truly contribute to mitigate the climate crisis. While statistics may show that it isn't extremely possible to create a large change, by changing the way we live our lives, including our diet, it is possible to do them and educate others to do the same. With everything I have learned, I find it easier to educate my family and those around me by showing them the same things that Ken has shown us. I think that once people learn what is really going on in the world around us, anyone would be willing to make a change. I enjoyed this lecture because it not only taught me realistic statistics but one again aided me with information on how to make a change.
<br><Hr>
I applaud Ken's encouragement for young voters to be involved in local and national elections. After all, we did take 20 minutes out of our 50-minute class just to register new, first-time voters. Now if that doesn't scream a professor who cares, then I don't know what does! If only more professors encouraged this- how awesome that would be.

As far as hydraulic fracking, it is upsetting to know that there is not much we can do personally to stop it other than voting. It's not like any of us live next to a hydraulic fracking site that we can protest outside of. This, however, makes me think of the show Santa Clarita Diet where the young climate activists blew up the fracking site with stolen bombs. Ha! Simple right? 

  <br><br>

I loved Ken's comment of "knowledge became power because it was acted upon by activists." I believe in the power that humans have to spark change. I believe that everyone can live a life by example. I believe we have the power to tackle this challenge. Yet sometimes I find it hard to believe that when I forego one burger that I am not doing anything to make a significant dent in the damage that has already shaken the Earth.

I loved the quote Ken used in this video: “don’t lose sight of the gorilla in the room”. I think people can easily be carried away with ideas of combating the climate crisis - for example, by driving electric cars. It seems like a lovely idea to drive a vehicle that doesn’t produce emissions, but in the grand scheme of things it won’t do much. Realistically, we must address the “gorilla” and focus our attention on issues such as hydraulic fracturing (a.k.a. fracking), which is the largest emitter of methane. That is something that individual action alone cannot influence and requires political action in addition to personal choices to change. 
  <br><br>
While I completely agree that personal action won’t nearly be enough to solve the climate crisis, we cannot lose sight of the fact that personal action among millions of people is what will create the necessary sweeping cultural change. I think that in order for the necessary changes to be made quickly enough, the majority of Americans have to be willing to participate and take effective action. 
  <br><br>

Voting, as insignificant it may seem, really is one of our most powerful tools to combat climate change, as it is the key to influencing problems that individual action cannot change on its own. As Ken said “if you can only do one thing to help mitigate the climate crisis” it is voting, specifically, voting for candidates advocate for sweeping climate change policies and prioritize the interests of the planet.

I agree with your idea that we should not ignore the gorilla in the room. Indeed, we can eat less meat and drive less automobile to reduce our personal carbon footprint, but that is definitely not enough. Actually, as Ken said, far from enough. What cause the largest amount of carbon emission are not individuals but the whole economic structure and policies around the structure. If we want to change the structure and lower the overall carbon emission, we must do this from a political perspective. The power is held in the hand of politicians and economics, what we can do to change this is by voting for those who has a determination of changing the economic structure. 
  <br><br>
This might seem like a small action that probably not help protect our environment as much as individual actions, but this is the most fundamental way to this problem. If we can choose a candidate that cares about the environment more than simply economic prosperity, the reduction of carbon emission would be far more than individual actions could do. In spite of this, we shouldn’t take this as an excuse to stop promoting individual actions to reduce personal carbon footprint.


<br><hr>
I agree, too often people focus on the small changes that individuals can make in their daily lives. While these are important, such as switching to a plant based diet, they will not solve the problem alone. I think that voting and political activism are the most effective way to help the climate crisis, along with making more sustainable lifestyle choices. People often focus on federal elections, but state and local ones are just as important when it comes to electing progressive candidates. Our vote has power, and by educating people on the importance of the climate crisis hopefully we can create large amounts of support for candidates who will do what is right for our planet. Throughout this class, I have been discussing what I have learned in order to educate them further on the climate crisis. My parents are fairly liberal people, so they were interested in what I had to say, and have already begun to be more conscious about their living choices. My dad even bought an electric bike! It is important to foster productive and educational conversations about this issue, even more so with people who do not see climate change as a problem. Like Ken said, we can’t lose sight of the gorilla in the room. Ignoring it will only make our situation more dire.

<br><hr>
I think we should be hesitant before stating that our individual actions are not impactful. Our actions do have an impact. For example, watching other car manufacturers react to Tesla and consumer sales has been emblematic of the larger economy. As individuals choose to move their dollars and purchasers towards more environmental solutions, the politics and companies will have to follow. The power which we, as consumers have, is key, and does give us power. We have multiple ways to vote – for our political leaders, and with our wallets. Choosing the companies we support is perhaps the more important pressing task. By choosing these companies intelligently, perhaps we can drive consumer and economical behavior towards behavior we want.

<br><hr>
Your part about how "personal action among millions of people is what will create the necessary sweeping cultural change" resonated with me. I think people abstaining from meat and driving electric cars is more than just a way to reduce CO2 in that specific way. By publically making an effort to alter personal actions, you spread awareness of the issue and help other people get involved and taking action. There is no way around it that in order to have any drastic climate action there will need to be a big change in how the public views the issue. Currently, the majority of the American public does not yet support actions such as the Green New Deal, as they believe the repercussions are larger than the threat posed by climate change. While I am neither endorsing or refuting this perspective, it is true that this is the current opinion. In order for that to change, there needs to be a dramatic societal shift, as you mentioned. 
  <br><br>
Just in my lifetime, I have seen how people taking personal action has inspired others to become involved in taking action, such as friends becoming inspired to buy solar panels or look into how to become politically active. While the broad culture cannot be changed by one person, the more people who start making changes is what will begin a movement. This is how we can address the "gorilla" problem even as we are making small changes. Just because the changes people make, such as eating vegan, may be seen as a distraction, those actions can help inspire people to have a change of perspective which contributes to addressing the larger problems.

<br><hr>
Yes! This point is important. We need to continuously educate and re-educate ourselves as new advancements and discoveries are made that pertain to this climate crisis. We must not ignore the big picture, but we must also remember change on a big scale cannot happen without individual action. 
  <br><br>
As for how to get the majority of Americans on board... I have no idea. I do not think we can rely on only voting. If Trump gets re-elected in this year's election, what is our plan then? Voting is our best shot, but as shown by the last election, the majority vote simply is not enough. We need a push. Without some kind of political revolution, our government will not be able to provide the U.S. with the means necessary to convince the general public to start digging us out of this deep hole we are in.
  <br><br>
I think we should overthrow the whole damn thing.
<br><hr>
I feel like many people feel discouraged to change as it feels like it's too much. I understand that it can be overwhelming and like you mentioned we have to focus on the "gorilla in the room". We have to regulate the destruction of our forests, our seas, our ecosystems by taking major action. I do however believe that those who can't help on a bigger scale bring great change by moving to a plant-based diet and by taking public transportation instead of driving their cars. Every action holds value and we can bring change by welcoming in any helping hand. I know we need a drastic change and fast, but I rather move to that change at a slower pace than not move at all. I completely agree that a major way to bring on this change is by voting, we as the people, unfortunately, don't hold as much power as officials do.  So by voting, we vote for those who know will bring those changes for us.

<br><hr>
I agree with your point that people would sooner rather drive electric cars than vote, despite the latter's greater importance. While voting does not seem like it has the impact that many people want to make, it is, like Ken says, the most important thing someone can do. Ideally, someone should not drive a car, fly, eat animal products, or produce any carbon emissions, but voting is a vital first step. Again, as you said, personal action is a necessity to achieve the desired result from climate activism. 
  <br><br>


I think in the status quo that Santa Barbara is starting to finally update its bike infrastructure. I could be mistaken, but I think that the street Ken talks about commuting on is one of the next streets that the city is planning to add a real bike path to, and that is a result of climate activism. People voting for politicians that will choose to implement policies like this is as much of a cause for the change as people protesting or confronting officials about the desired change. The only difference is that voting does not really have a lot of glory behind it. 
  <br><br>


At the end of the day, I feel like most people in this country want some level of recognition from their peers for going out of their way to help the environment, and I am not really an exception to this even though I would like to think so. It is a more obvious change for someone to opt for an electric car than a gas car, and that change is easily recognizable by their peers. But, just because voting is not as glory filled as other forms of activism does not take away its status as the most important action.

<br><hr>
Love your comment and your name!! Political action is incredibly important in reversing climate change. In all honesty, because politics can be such a hostile environment, I try to avoid it. However, I'm waking up to the fact that it is incredibly important to vote, especially because the things that need to be done to reach zero emissions involve political action. However, personal action and activism are still very important as well. I also believe that personal action and activism is very important when it comes to living an intentional and fulfilling life.

If enough people change to bicycles this can create an amazing trend where everyone changes towards a bicycle style of transportation. Just like cars became a trend in the mid 20th century but now with eco friendly transportation and if everyone goes on board with this the people that own cars would look down upon for damaging the earth. This sounds like bullying but it’s be bullying for good which is not letting the world became a disastrous planet which is a pretty good reason.

After reading the title's question I just felt the urge to answer it immediately, since my answer represents a lot of things I wanted to say after reading some similar comments for a while now.
  <br><br>
All of them matter EQUIVALENTLY. 
  <br><br>
Yes, you heard me right, all of them matter, and I prioritize them equally. I have been seeing comments saying that "The power of actions coming from individuals are insignificant when all others don’t change" and it quickly falls to conclusions such as "So whether or not I act it won't make a difference, so I shouldn't be acting until most people have the consciousness", it's not only depressing to read, they can literally bug me for a whole day. 
  <br><br>
First of all, individual actions are important though it is true that political actions will have more direct impacts. It is still essential for individuals like us to act first and live a life that is environmental-friendly so that we can understand better about how it is like, and confirm that it is doable. Only after that can we teach our friends and family on how to practically act against climate change, not just in the level of “we should do something” and forget about it very soon. Furthermore, what right do we have to become climate activism, and how hypocrite it will be if we become politically active demanding more people put on actions, while we never act in the first place? It is very important not because it will make a difference immediately, but rather it helps us know at least what we are doing, and it’s the first thing someone should do for others to follow.
  <br><br>

Up next, climate activism represents one of the real voices coming from society, and political power ensures that the voice can be heard and won’t be marginalized because it doesn’t benefit the industrial system. These two are definitely the bulks in terms of direct impacts and will educate more individuals which leads to a change of culture in its core. Moreover, becoming politically active will increase the pass chances of legislations such as the Green New Deal, political power is always more impactful and direct. After all, we might not have more time to wait for a relatively slow transformation in culture. In conclusion, all three of them are equally important, individual actions are the first step, climate activism help to transform our culture and becoming politically active yields more power which is the real deal.
  <br><br>

The reason those comments made me depressed was due to the fact that this class only directly educate around 800 students a quarter, assuming all of us have no background of knowledge of climate change, we only have 800 more individuals who realize the problems with our culture and lifestyle, potentially more family members or friends dedicate on doing more or keep doing things that stop climate changes. Then those comments helped me realize my optimism. If even a college student exposed to so many horrifying facts about climate changes, can still be feared when asked to make life-changes to save the environment. It just shows how addicting we have truly become, and how it is even harder for people with lower educations.

Before listening to this lecture video, I always knew that fracking was a huge problem to our environment but upon hearing that it made up half of the oil and two thirds of the gas we produce in the US is from fracking. That is completely insane to me. Not only are we creating products for us to burn and release CO2 but we are releasing large sums of methane into the air while doing so. These numbers are disgusting and need to change but as Ken goes on to describe, we ourselves can not change this from happening, we must get the right people in our governmental system to help us get these changes happening. Becoming a climate activist is one of the great ways to make this happen. Even if you are unable to devote your time you can vote for politicians who are willing to help our environment. However, what Ken forgets to think of people's biographical availability. This is a term often used in Sociology to address all of the components of one’s life that may make them more or less available to perform certain acts. For example, at UCSB we have quite a large diverse group of international students. International students are not able to help vote on acts or politicians like other students to help and some of them may also be afraid to become an environmental activist because if the activism they are working with takes a wrong turn they could be kicked out of the country. Another example, this one based around food, is that not everyone is built to live off of a vegan or a vegetarian diet and switching their diets could cause them to be underweight or affect their health status. In addition, in some areas the cost of meat substitutes and fresh produce can be much more expensive than the mass-produced meat. In those areas, a vegetarian or vegan diet may not be economically available to everyone. Lastly, for transportation, in rural areas there are no efficient public transportation which leads people to have to use their cars to get to and from their travel destinations. All these factors of biographical availability can make it hard for some people to be able to help the US decrease our gas emissions and that is just how it is unfortunately.

I agree with you that some issues, especially the huge, international ones, can only be solved through voting the right people into office. However, even though people’s biographical availability varies and individuals cannot stop such large practices like fracking, I believe that there is always something that every person can do to make a positive difference. For example, sharing information is always an influential action that is possible for many people. By simply sharing information about fracking in a class presentation, or talking to your friends and family about the issue and which politicians are against or support it, or even making a social media post with a few key facts, is an eye-opening step that can cause change. For example, many of the people who watched this video were shocked and in disbelief of the gravity of the situation. We were never taught this information before, and just by having access to it, more people are conscious of the issue and will be more likely to vote accordingly.
  <br><br>
While it is very true that not everyone has the ability to completely change their lifestyles to become fully environmentally friendly, this is not a sound reason to not make any changes at all because this is the way it is. Every small environmentally friendly change is a change in a positive direction that would not have happened at all before. For example, while an international student may not feel safe protesting in another country, they could reduce their meat/dairy consumption, even by one meal a day, or choose more often to ride their bike instead of driving. People who would become unhealthy by reducing their consumption of meat and dairy can encourage others who can reduce their animal product consumption, to do so. Even sharing information about the environmental truth of animal agriculture or encouraging Meatless Mondays in their families would be a step in a positive direction. For people who have no access to public transportation, they could advocate for cleaner methods of travel through their local governments, start carpooling more, or even raise awareness and share knowledge about the environmental impacts of so many cars on the road. If that is not feasible, there are countless ways to reduce someone’s environmental footprint other than the ones already mentioned, such as composting food, reusing and recycling, not supporting companies that are environmentally unsustainable, and sharing information on how to make the planet greener. The world will not change by people making all or nothing choices, but by each individual making any small changes they can, which altogether combines into a movement of environmental progress.


<br><Hr>
Yes, I was also shocked to know that fracking is also a big problem for carbon emissions. Humans are creating carbon to fill out our Earth, unnecessary energy use like fast fashions and luxuries. We’ve been releasing so much CO2 into the atmosphere. I have the same question as you have. First, it is hard for people to convert to a vegan diet. We are educated to have eggs, meat and vegans every day and this is a good lifestyle. Also, for labor on construction sites, they are manual laborers. They need meat and fat to supply essential needs. It is impossible for them to be vegans. Also, bikes are good for environment but it is plausible for every city. If you live in a more population-concentrated city, it is excellent for people to ride bikes to work and go out. If you live in a city which has few people and facilities are scattered, you must drive. The reality limits what we can do in fact.
  <br><br>
Still, I agree that bike is good for some cities like Beijing or Tokyo or even New York. We can ride bikes to work which saves our time, fewer traffic jam and fewer carbon emissions. For other cities with scattered communities, people can choose to bike when they go to nearby places. Bike can be an option for them. Professor Ken introduces that annual carbon emissions in Copenhagen have reduced 3.8 million. If people can choose to ride a bike as much as possible, a lot of CO2 will be reduced.

When Ken finally brought up the role of political action, I finally felt like this class was showing some real strategies for change. I'm glad he addresses political action by voting since it's more of a realistic way for all of us to start making a change in our society a day. I will be voting and I too encourage everyone else to do the same as our environment is needing our help.

Yep. The highest value thing you can do is to vote for the right president. The second highest value thing you can do is vote for the right governor. The third and the fourth and the fifth are basically all extensions of that - long story short, vote in the change you wish to see in the world.

This video was interesting to hear as it shows what is truly necessary to make a large impact in mitigating climate change. While personal lifestyle changes are meaningful, it is simply not enough. Voting is the way to make a profound difference as it can affect a whole region, state, or the country, not just the individual. The history behind Copenhagen’s bike-heavy culture is interesting as it shows that individuals, collectively, can influence governments and cultures to become more environmentally friendly. It gives me hope that people can actually succeed at making these types of initiatives more commonplace.

In this class, we  learned that individual action would have a relatively small effect in mitigating the climate crisis. But we also learned that individual action is nonetheless important. Though I do agree that individual action (particularly if you are able to do so) is important, I didn’t know how to explain why. This lecture made me better understand why by viewing as individual action, climate activism, and becoming politically active as intergrally connected. 
  <br><br>

 The example of Copahagen that our professor gave us is a great example; an individual lifestyle change in transportation, or at least accepting it, was a great pushing factor in creating a city to fit the needs of cyclists. As Ken mentioned, this was acheived through a “bottom-up” approach, meaning that policy was able to change because of the push of the mass majority of people. This was able to create a change in culture, and relatively quick. Therefore, we are socialized into everything through conditions created by people, and by understanding this, we can see how quick culture can be changed. Therefore, as mentioned, all three; personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active are all equally important in mitigating the climate crisis. 
  <br><br>

 It made me happy to see how many carbons of CO2 Copenhagen was able to reduce by simply 62% of its population switching to biking. A reduction of 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 from just switching mode of tranportation. I searched online, and there are around 50,000 cities globally. I did rough math and estimated that if a quarter of the cities were similar to Copenhagen in structure and would also reduce around 3.8 billion tons of CO2 by ⅔ of its population switching to bicycling, 47.5 billion pounds of CO2 would be reduced, which is a significant number. I would imagine that public transporation in place of cars would reduce CO2 emissions way more and by the billions as well.
  <br><br>

 Nonetheless, climate activism, and activism itself is detrimental to creating any change. If you are making individual actions in mitigating the climate crisis, but not taking part in climate action outside of that, you are unfortuntely not creating any substantial and lasting change. Mass movements have been made by masses of people, collective strength proves to be very powerful, as we see even outside of climate activism, and in other movements, such as the COLA movement that our grad students UCwide and supporters have shown us.

Like Ken mentioned in this video, taking personal action can lower your own individual carbon footprint. By choosing to eat a primarily plant-based diet, one can lower their carbon emissions greatly. By giving up or even lowering your beef consumption, you can dramatically cut your impact on the planet. Compared to other countries in the world, Americans are consuming way more beef annually. This consumption of mass beef is one of the largest problems we face as a country. Even if it seems like individual action has no impact on the planet, it does. The fact that we cannot directly see the impact that our actions have is what makes it so hard. It may seem a bit hopeless as results are not easily seen or readily felt. Despite all this, people should make changes in their lifestyle where they could afford to make them. 
  <br><br>


Another important step in mitigating our greenhouse gas emissions is through activism. Just like Ken mentioned, we can all do our part by putting ourselves out there, partaking in protests, and having our voices be heard. In Denmark, the city of Copenhagen was able to bring about change from bottom-up to make the city more bicycle-friendly. If this type of change were to be brought and implemented in the US this would help cut our emissions immensely. As a country that relies heavily on cars as a means of transportation, by making the streets safer for bicycles, more people would feel inclined to bike instead of driving everywhere. 
  <br><br>


Activism is also really important in bringing about change. If we want to save the planet, we have to change our country and how we do things. Voting is the simplest way to bring about change in our government. We need to vote for representatives that care about our environment and the future of the planet. We need to support those that care more about us than corporate interests. We need to go out and vote, otherwise nothing will change.

My biggest takeaway from this lecture video was that I should put forth more effort into becoming an activist for climate management. As I am right now, I have about an above average level of personal and political action. Personally, I have changed my consumption habits to comply more with what the world needs along with taking up changes such as carpooling, walking, decreased air travel, and decreased use of single-use plastics. Politically, I also participate in voting every year and do research into which candidates I believe would best represent my environmental interests. However, I realized that I barely take part in actual climate activism. I rarely attend protests and also hesitate to bring up my views on the environment with friends and family. 

  <br><br>

As Ken referred to many times in his lecture video, all three actions are interconnected and must be taken in order for real change to be made. Because of this I want to try to improve my own actions and maybe be involved in something revolutionary like Copenhagen’s environmental victory. I found it awe-inspiring that Copenhagen was able to pressure their local government officials into making the changes the citizens wanted to see. Because of this, 62% of the citizens living there use bikes to get around, more so than cars. Due to the tenacity of their citizens, Copenhagen was able to make a big difference and I hope to challenge myself one day to do something similar by following their example.

In regards to Ken’s question at the end of this lecture video, I think all play a big role in what we can do to help mitigate the climate crisis. I believe that at first, it begins with personal lifestyle changes such as going vegan or riding a bicycle to work. After this, we begin to see the changes that should be made in others' lifestyles or how much improvement is needed, such as better bike paths. This leads many people to talk about their own lifestyles and compare them, which can lead to one influences another. Many Americans want to make it look like they are better than others and prove their place in social settings. Therefore, if going Vegan and recycling is seen as a great thing to do, then many others will do it as well. Personally, my carbon footprint from eating less meat is not good enough to slow down the climate crisis. So, many may wonder “why do it if it won’t even make a difference?” I think it's important for others to know the impact of taking a stand and bringing attention to something. It pushes many others into the same thing and will eventually lead to climate activism. Before this class and being surrounded by so many others who are aware of climate change, I was unmotivated to make a difference in my own lifestyle. I would have never even thought about cutting beef out of my diet or giving my money to organizations. To make a real difference though, we do need to vote politicians into offices where they can implement changes for the whole state/country. This is the most important thing that we can do. Climate activism might make a difference and put the idea of change into the politicians' minds, but they are ultimately the ones to make the changes. Support those who want to make a change and educate those who need it.

I can relate to many points that you mentioned in your comment. I think that it is very viable and doable for each person to contribute and help mitigate the climate crisis. They can change their diet, they can change their living style, they can vote, ...etc. There's so many options to do anything for the climate crisis as anything can have an impact for it. 
  <br><br>
I do also think that the first step is a change in lifestyle. As I've mentioned in my previous comments, I think the first and best way is to change the culture and thinking of the people. More people need to accept climate change as a real and threatening issue to our way of lives. Therefore, people cannot keep living the lifestyle they are currently. Something needs to change in order to improve the situation. Your point in "taking a stand and bringing attention to something" really hits the spot of Ken's video and the core of the issue. Other people need to be aware of the climate crisis and act, no matter how small of an act. If small changes aren't happening, how can we expect bigger changes to happen?

After watching Ken’s video, I feel optimistic for the future of our planet. It feels good to be reminded that we, the people really do have the power to make widespread, institutional change. The circulating false narrative that individuals can’t make any significant impact on climate change needs to come to an end. We can change our daily lifestyle, promote cultural shifts that support sustainability, speak out and be active, and even vote. The fact that the people of Copenhagen were able to reduce their yearly carbon emissions by 3.8 billion pounds is incredible. Local government and small-scale activism really can change the world. People also don’t realize that voting for local government officials can also make a serious impact on the problem, bottom-up change is a real thing and Copenhagen is a perfect example of how when one community takes a stand and makes a difference, it inspires communities all round the world to make similar change. If everyone had the mentality that their individual voice mattered, we would have already undergone a total climate revolution. But until then, it’s so important to keep reminding people that we CAN make a difference. Imagine if we got the state of California to invest in bike-friendly infrastructure, pushed public officials to ban fracking, and voted for candidates who support the Green New Deal. This is really just a matter of motivation, the more people see environmental activists make a difference, or politicians advocating for change, the more people will join the movement. It’s really that simple.

I agree with you. I too would like to see the end of fracking; it just looks ugly along coastal areas. The way I would summarize these past few videos is by simply saying, "Go vote" because what Ken did in this video is simply build up anticipation for possible solutions in x amount of minutes to simply say "Vote for good officials that support positive actions for the climate." So yes, we ALL CAN make a difference simply by voting. Though I feel as if constant pressuring of voting would annoy some people and wouldn't promote the action any better than just not saying anything. I say this because getting constant ads of political candidates gets annoying at times. It sucks that everything is tied to the principle of politics, but that's just showbiz baby.

Personally, I appreciate seeing this side of Ken, for I enjoy his personal anecdotes; it's nice to hear that he practices what he speaks. 
  <br><br>

In regards to biking, it is of utmost importance to build good bike structures in the US. This will encourage more people to start biking, because lack of infrastructure is a large obstacle that hinders it.
  <br><br>

When first moving to UCSB, I was afraid of biking to and from Portola from Campus; I was afraid of the what could potentially happen to me on a bike on a crowded street. However, after seeing the reserved bike lanes towards one side of the road, I was relived. This provided a large barrier between my unprotected body, and giant, fast killing machines. This is hands down, the best bicycle accommodations I've seen, ever. This accommodation is what encouraged me to make my commute to Portal, and may I add an enjoyable commute as well.
   <br><br>

With the government allocating more resources to roads, highways, and other infrastructures, it encourages more cars to populate the road. The solution is not to expand our car-housing streets, but to expand our bike lanes. This will encourage more people to use them, which can create a large dent in our CO2 emissions.

I totally agree with you that the government should allocate more resources to expand our bike lanes. I think this is the most important take-away in this video, as Ken argues how personal actions and governmental and broader actions are connected. This becomes clear for me after watching this video. Relying on personal and cultural changes are not enough to save the planet as Ken provides a series of data and examples to illustrate. The more essential topic now is how we can transfer cultural awareness into a bigger wave of movement that solves the climate crisis from the root. This requires collective works, and especially the government should unify people and resources in order to create more bike lanes and promote the notion of cycling. I also have the same feeling as you when I first move to UCSB. Regardless of being a bike fan back home, I was still afraid of biking on busy streets with cars and people. However, when I came to UCSB and saw traffic lights specifically for bikes, turntables, and the abundance of bike lanes, I was thrilled. I find that commuting through biking is not on the paper but the reality, which is the most important and direct way of personal action that can contribute to saving the planet.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. I do not feel that there is a major downside to biking. It is way more affordable than buying a car and it is great exercise and in some cases it does not take that much longer than driving a car and when you think about it I think that the added time is more than enough to compensate for the price difference. I do agree that biking can be scary sometimes as well, especially if there is no designated bike path and you are just sharing the road with other cars. I was so scared to bike my first year, that I did not start biking until the beginning of my second quarter and even when I did, I left a half an hour before my classes started so that I could avoid all the students getting out of their classes. I can say for myself that I have not been in a bike accident or crash and I have been biking on campus for over a year now. The set up of the bike paths at UCSB makes it easy for people to get around without causing interference with any other modes of transportation. I also enjoy it because on my way to classes I get to see posters that inform me of all of the events that are going on. I agree and I hope that bikes will become more popular once there are certain guides that are passes that make it much easier and safer to bike. This will prove to be better for the earth than automobile transportation. We just need to create ways so that biking everywhere can become easier and safer and somehow discourage automobile use on roads, as a way to make bicycles more popular and numerous than cars.

<br><hr>
I agree with this comment, as nationalizing the use of bike lanes would go a long way to increasing bike use. I feel that even if we were to change the building requirements to construct roads to have bike lanes, it could go a long way, as many people would feel safer to use bikes and commute to work.
   <br><br>


For example, I live in a small farming town, and the roads there are super crappy and not a priority to the city at all. Trying to bike there is impossible, as the roads are barley even wide enough so 2 cars can drive by. The topic was eventually brought to the city council, but they elected not to spend the money on bike lanes, as it wouldn't be cost effective, as it would raise the cost to maintain the roads. However, I feel that if bike lanes were built, no matter the price, it would reduce the price to maintain the roads, as less people would be driving on them.

In this video, Ken brought up a lot of great ideas, and it makes me realize the true value behind our daily actions. It makes me think that all the efforts that we put to be more environmentally friendly are not useful at all.  It is surprising that even of all the people on the earth become vegan, it would not be enough to mitigate the climate crisis. I learned how powerful people’s rights to vote (even if I have no right to vote as an international student.) I realized the relationship between personal actions and political actions.

I agree with you in that the biggest lesson to take away from this video is that of understanding how important voting is. Having the right to vote allows people a voice in politics; this is especially important when voting on a local issues as they are more likely to directly affect you. It’s upsetting to know that so many do not vote out of frustration in believing they can’t make a difference and others because of laziness. Voting is one of the best forms of activism.
   <br><br>


In addition, activism through lifestyle changes such as riding a bike instead of driving a car have so many benefits and are often pushed onto people as though it were sincerely an easy task to take on. I am so glad that you mention the problems that arise through riding a bike, not only is it intimidating but sometimes even deadly when cities’ do not have proper or safe bike lanes. To be quite honest, I am actually impressed with Santa Barbara’s few bike lanes, in the Bay Area there are hardly any designated bike routes and when they are, as mentioned by Ken, they are clearly an afterthought in which bike riders are meant to ride dangerously next to parked and moving cars. This becomes an instant barrier between people who genuinely want to drive their bike as they feel unsafe.



<br><hr>
I also think its really surprising that if everyone on the planet went vegan it still wouldn't be enough. People often think going vegan is some sort of righteous action that will solve all of our environmental issues when in reality it is just one of the many many things we all need to do to improve the condition of our Earth. Nobody really seems to pay attention to the little things here and there that actually add up to a large carbon footprint. For example, the recycling of refrigerators is the largest personal action people can make for the environment. Most people wouldn't think twice before sending their fridge to the dump. Making people more aware of these small things would make a huge difference. Even better, making laws preventing these small things from giving everyone a large carbon footprint would ensure a better success rate. This connects to what you said about voting. It is so important for us to put people into power who really care about the environment because ultimately they are the ones who are going to be in control of what happens. If our president actually believed in climate change and cared, we would probably be way farther ahead than we are right now.

I understand that we need to be more politically active in order to fight against the climate crisis but I also don't like that everything has to be political. Some issues aren't a political debate, and shouldn't be treated as such.l Also who is the say that a candidate we vote for can get things done with so many politicians that are bought out by the fossil fuel companies. Or those politicians who just want the vote so they pose as a climate activist but just make empty promises. The system is set up to come to a conclusion that will help us immediately.

I personally have never been on the bike lane because I walk everywhere but I will definitely need one next year. I've heard of many bike accidents happening on campus and I know it makes people feel uneasy about biking on campus. I've always thought that something needs to change to ensure more safety because a majority of students on campus travel by bike. I grew up in San Francisco, a pretty bike friendly city! I've always noticed the lanes specifically created for bikes separated by poles to prevent a car from entering. This is necessary, because pained lines are not enough to prevent accidents. The poles create a physical barrier that protect both cars and cyclists. I often hear people from San Francisco complaining that the bike lanes make the already narrow streets too tight for cars. I believe there is something to be done about that without removing the protected bike lanes. 
   <br><br>
Another comment on this video mentioned that cyclists will often ride on the sidewalk because it is safer reminded me of this dangerous reality for cyclists. Bikes certainly do not belong in sidewalks where pedestrians are, but bikes also deserve a safe lane to travel and this should not be a place where cars will also be active. Cars are dangerous and can be deadly, so why would it make sense for people who are only protected by a helmet and maybe some knee and elbow pads allowed on the same lane? The deaths that Ken mentioned break my heart because they were people simply commuting somewhere, going about their lives, for it to come to an end because of unsafe biking conditions. 
   <br><br>
This lecture made me think about a solution that had never crossed my mind before. I knew that biking over driving would be a great change but I hadn't though about the dangers associated with it. Advocating for safer bike conditions and more bike lanes is now on my radar and I'll try to share this with my friends who bike.

After watching this week's lecture video, I feel more grateful for coming to UCSB as we are a huge biking community. I have known that changing to a bike rather than a car would help the climate crisis tremendously. In order to achieve this and be more like Copenhagen and other places, we have to consider things such as safety and creating more bike lanes. As part of our personal action regarding transportation, we can persuade the public to choose public transportation or bikes instead of their cars
   <br><br>

Voting can be the first step for actual change to happen. Without voting for candidates that are more environmentally conscious we would not be doing the earth a service. If we elect someone else like Trump the earth could downgrade any more

Yeah I take issue in how we used the example of Denmark to naively say that the USA could also implement the same measures to make people bike instead of drive.
   <br><br>
Firstly, Ken used the argument that Denmark was supposedly super cold because it was high up north, ignoring the fact that Denmark is actually not that cold because of the Gulf Stream.
   <br><br>
But really the biggest issue in the USA regarding implementing a biking culture is simply the geography and the urban planning of our country. We here at UCSB we are in our little bubble of living in densely populated areas where many things are accessible by bike and where a wealthy public institution charging high tuition can actually afford to make a bike lane system.
   <br><br>
This is not a reality for  80%+ of US areas. Try living in an Atlanta suburb or in middle-of-nowhere Arkansas with only a bike. Good luck mate.
   <br><br>
But more seriously, the US's urban areas are simply horribly designed to accommodate non-motorized transportation. A country like Denmark which is rather dense does not have this problem (as much).


<br><hr>
I feel great as well recognizing that this campus is bike-friendly, but will admit some of the paths need some reconstruction because it does get bumpy in some places. Also, I feel like more funding needs to be placed in infrastructure that would go into making bike paths that are safer to be in and kept away directly from car traffic, like a barrier of some sort. So honestly this needs to be brought to more politicians who then could allocate funds to improve the wellbeing of bikers and make it more accessible in more places, because not everywhere is like our campus. Voting is super important as well in order to get the attention of our government (local and federal) that the citizens want change, so for those who have the ability to so hopefully they are taking advantage of the opportunity. Also, I think developing a bullet train system would do wonders as it provides a means of fast transportation for many at once, but who knows when that'll become more a discussion occurring among the US Department of Transportation.

This lecture in a way was sort of a review about many things we have already learned about in this class. Ken went over several things such as bike use, plant-based diet, and voting while explaining climate change activism. Ken made an excellent point about climate change activism when he mentioned that it is not required to be famous, or a politician to be an activist. I feel that way too often people view it as that and tend to be a lot more relaxed in regards to making individual life changes to better the environment. That being the unfortunate reality of things is why voting is one of the only ways that can really make major changes in the positive direction. By getting the right people in office it will allow for documents such as the Green New Deal to become a part of United States legislation and shift our countries priorities into those of which will have a good outcome on the planet. That being said, it is still important for each individual to be an activist in their own personal life even if you are not able to give up every single thing. Take myself for example, I would like to say that I am currently beginning to transform into a climate change activist and I have already changed several ways of my lifestyle before. For example I do not use cars for transportation nor do I use planes to fly which are two things that can really make your carbon footprint sky rocket upwards. I have also begun to eat more of a plant-based diet as I have not yet completely become vegan yet, but might make the full transition at some point. These are three things that I can say I am pretty active in, but it does not mean if you do not practice these you are bad it is just important to reflect on yourself and change the things you are willing to change. Lastly, I just want to mention how motivational Copenhagen was and how I truly believe one day we can get to that place here in the United States. Just a simple switch to bikes would be a good change for many for both health reasons and environmental reasons. I want to just end on how important VOTING is and I strongly encourage that everyone that is eligible does so in the upcoming election.

I believe that as long as one person has the mind to take a small action, we will absolutely gain a little hope on mitigating the climate crisis. To me, personal actions are the BIG MAIN thing we can put effort in. I admire and respect the changes you have made or started to make, which might be a difficult step for some people. Moreover, I think there are plenty of people who already are living in lives that’s completely different from those of a decade ago. It doesn’t mean the United States will be a failure when big differences of any other aspects are existing. I prefer being a freegan, yet I have been adjusting my eating and commuting habits for a while. Finally, what Ken mentioned in the lecture should be considered essential and effective. VOTING the right candidate can be extremely influential for the nation. A simple action can bring a huge change.

The one thing that Ken emphasized in this lecture video is the importance of voting. I agree that voting is extremely important in changing the decisions of the world, but it is also essential to pay respects to your citizenship to your country. As someone who does not have the right to vote here in the US, I find it frustrating when I see that people who do have the right to vote, don't vote. People need to recognize that the ability to vote is a privilege. In my situation, I would like to vote to change many things for the benefit of the country that I'm living in and calling my home. But because I can't, seeing those who can vote abuse their privileges disappoints me. Here I am living in a country having to abide by rules and regulations that I have no say in and being content with it while others have the opportunity to be a part of changing the way they live, but are complaining about how they have no say and hate the system. If you have the chance to vote, please do; because there are others who have to live under the conditions of the country no matter what, and they would much rather have a say in the ways of the country that they call their home. Please recognize that voting is a privilege and exercise that right.

This video to the great job showing how our daily actions can affect how much we contribute to climate change. Also showing that certain watching my life we can adjust picture once we can adjust that have more impact. Such as installing water efficient taps, we could cut out beef in conserve a lot of water. Also how voting can have a significant impact, take a look at what each candidate stands for and if it lines with your beliefs and the benefit of the climb. The climate crisis is put on by the whole world but certain people influence it much more than others. Americans need to take into account that they have significant impact over way more people than just United States we impact the whole world and ourselves. So I have to pass if we don’t take proper measures in our own lives to support the climate.

I really admire your experience about environmental protection. I think I'm the same as you. I've paid great attention to protecting the environment as much as possible in my daily life. For example, I take the bus to go to school every day, order as much as I can eat, and don't waste food. When chatting with friends and family, I also remind them to drive less and invest in high-tech projects rather than heavy industry projects. However, what I can do is far from enough. I still need to take a taxi to go to a far place. I still need to fly from the United States to China, or I am used to buying clothes on a regular basis. These behaviors will have different degrees of impact on the environment, because they are emitting a lot of carbon dioxide. How to make it more environmentally friendly is also a problem I need to think about.

It was interesting to see Denmark used as a representation of other countries in the world. For a whole country to realize that that their carbon footprint is detrimental the well-being of their country and try to take the steps needed to fix it is amazing and the United States  should take notes. For example, they ride bikes or take public transportation rather than driving is really cool to see. The number of vehicles in Denmark has decreased after years, but the number of cars in the Unites States only increases.

In the United States, having a car, several cars, or nice cars is seen as higher class status. If you can afford a nice car, then you have money. In most European countries, most families choose to rely on public transportation, have one small and environmentally-friendly car, one expensive car, such as an Audi, or they bike everywhere. These options are significantly better than cars in America, such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, or trucks with massive exhaust pipes; families even tend to have more than 1 or 2 cars per family. If being conscious about our impacts on the environment was seen as cooler than the modification of cars, we would be better at preserving our environment. Denmark's population was able to save 3.8 billions of pounds CO2 by choosing to bike instead of drive.

This video brings up a lot of points surrounding the interpretation of our roles in climate change. Ken brings up the counter argument of the uselessness of changing one’s own unsustainable lifestyle choices because they would be “not enough” to fight anthropogenic emissions. But I find this idea to be rather ignorant. Sure, a couple people going vegan or buying reusable water bottles isn’t going to heal our atmosphere, but it’s all part of a plan. Individual behavior leads to societal change, meaning that a few people rewiring themselves to act more eco friendly will form a movement of sustainable living. No one seemed to care about day to day plastic waste until Hydro Flasks and plastic straws became popular. Personal changes in the way we interact with our world and its resources creates waves of sustainability. For example, Greta Thunberg started off as a young student protestor. And now she has transformed her ideas and beliefs into a generational movement. It’s clear to see that a popular interest in a concept or group is how mass change starts off. If no one cared about the oceans, then there wouldn’t be any local legislation against fishing or oil spills, let alone national laws. In Kopenhagen, the prioritization of bikers didn’t occur until it’s citizens showed an interest in more eco-friendly transportation. Our everyday actions, whether we realize it or not, lead to global consequences. Mass change begins with you, not the other way around.

Although our personal actions might not be enough alone, I do think that even our smallest effort can make a difference. As Ken mentioned, it is important that we lead by example. Being politically active, an activists and incorporating personal actions brings us closer to reaching our goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For our transportation situation in the US, I believe we should begin to advocate locally and work up from there. As Ken mentioned, Copenhagen has adapted to other cultural changes such as bicycle use which is something the US needs and it all started locally. It is amazing that 62% of their population commute by bicycle. Of course, if we would like to achieve such goals we’d have to advocate for better bicycle infrastructure in our cities. Before we begin to ask, we must get our community on board and I feel that is the area in which we struggle. As ken mentioned that many will not jump on board to become vegan, many will also not choose to let go of their car. It is important that the communities come together and those who really wish to see change become activist and become politically active.

In my eighth grade American History class, in my junior year APUSH class, and throughout my entire life, I’ve heard that voting is my civic duty as an American citizen. Teachers would constantly tell me that my vote is important even though seemingly minor. Having recently turned 18, this is the first election that I can vote in. It’s exciting and empowering, but people around me talk about voting in a cynical way. I continue to think that if we all trust that our votes matter, they will because of our collective belief and effort. 
   <br><br>


To answer the question “which matters more?” out of personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active, I agree with Ken’s sentiment that all three are intimately related. It’s hard to take one apart from the other two. However, the easiest of the three is definitely becoming politically active. Of course, it requires doing research on local, state, and national candidates and policies. After informing our opinions, all it takes is going to the polls on election day (or sending in your ballot!). 

   <br><br>

The area of climate change mitigation that I contribute to the most at this point is personal action. I know that one person doing these things isn’t enough, and even everyone becoming vegan wouldn’t be enough, but doing what I personally can gives me hope. It’s almost analogous to voting in that sense. Though one vote is small in the scope of our eligible voter population, if we all think that our personal vote doesn’t matter and choose not to vote, change will not happen. In the same way, though one person taking steps in their life to reduce their climate footprint is small, the actions are valid. I know that massive change is necessary for the preservation of our world, we must acknowledge the importance of personal action as a step in the right direction for our nation.

Biking in a major metropolitan city would be interesting, to say the least. I personally never got my drivers license not because I wanted to save the environment, but because it was a hassle for me to go through the process when I already had amazing public transportation available to me. After moving to suburbia my parents had to drive me everywhere as there was no direct bus line to get where I needed to gogo. If we increase funding for public transportation people will just naturally switch over increasing productivity, lower traffic congestion, and lower carbon emissions.

   <br><br>

A lot of the solutions for dealing with climate change would be useful for our economy as well, we need new infrastructure for our country, why not make it green?

Your joke about biking is really funny-- but I completely agree with the sentiment you put forward in your comment. We need to rebuild our economy and our infrastructure right now as we have not transitioned to a modern economy yet and have crumbling infrastructure left over from the sixties. We need to vote to rebuild the economy in the way you described focusing on building green infrastructure designed to increase our economic output, reaping rewards from both.

When considering my potential contribution towards mitigating the climate crisis, I often think about it with strict boundaries-either diving into protests or intense activism, or becoming vegan, or changing my mode of transportation. However, this lecture asserted that all aspects of climate action are interrelated and equally important. In answer to the lecture’s title question, Ken states, “Activism, voting, and personal action can be, and very often are, intimately related”. I appreciated Kens personal anecdote of his alternative mode of transportation, an electric bike powered by pedaling rather than gasoline. He made a strong point that by practicing transportation activism like such, and fueling the bottom-up effect proven to be successful in Copenhagen’s bike-dominant society, we can truly shift social structures. It is mind-blowing to me, in such a car-frenzied world, that Copenhagen managed to transform into a majority biking society (2/3 of the population).
   <br><br>

Drawing inspiration from other developed countries exhibiting responsible and sustainable adjustments to daily life, it makes me hopeful that our country can share that mindset, hopefully in the near future. Besides even contemplating environmental complications, unsustainable practices like driving a fuel-powered car puts civilians in danger too. As referred to in the lecture, Copenhagen adopted safe bike lanes in response to majority biking. Infrastructure will adapt to our lifestyles because the demand will be higher than it is currently.

It is definitely a new challenge being told that changing your diet/personal life will ultimately have little impact on the climate crisis that we are facing. It's especially jarring to learn considering the recent lifestyle-change movement employed in my generation lately; that is, popularizing using re-usable silverware/straws, encouraging thrifting instead of fast-fashion shopping,  and even going vegetarian or vegan for the sake of the environment rather than a personal reason. It does make sense that if we need to act now, the only way we can incite mass change is through environmental activism in order to pressure politicians to implement policies that work better for the Earth. 
   <br><br>


It's actually super impressive that Ken bikes to work EVERY day--I always assumed he biked around campus and drove to work, but I guess it makes sense since he is the king of environmental activism. I really liked how he presented a different perspective on how to pressure politicians, like pushing for more bike-friendly roads etc. When I first moved to Isla Vista, I was honestly pretty shocked at how virtually everyone biked to get around. It was especially new for me to see bike paths everywhere, even implemented on campus. I come from a city in the Central Valley called Visalia, and here, there are bike paths in some places, and I see maybe 1 or 2 bicycles every week. The main method of transportation is through cars, and it's almost unfeasible to imagine Visalia having a biking culture surrounding it. It would definitely be super interesting to see how my city could change if such bike laws were implemented here!

Ken mentioning that when he first started using a pedal-generated-power bike in high school, he was made fun of made me further think about our current societal issues around transportation. While there are some people who simply cannot live with the idea of not using a car all the time, a lot of people are not so against the idea, but are more worried about what other people will think. It is sad that we care at all what other people think in the first place, but it is a valid and reasonable concern. Automobiles have been considered as a sign of wealth and prosperity since the rise of the American Dream post-WWII, and it somehow became deeply engrained in society that owning a car and having a good life are mutually exclusive. We therefore need to shift the way that others see vehicle usage before we can make significant strides in achieving sustainable means of transportation. 
    <br><br>

I lived in Copenhagen throughout high school, and what Ken mentioned is completely right. EVERYONE I knew got to school either by bike, train, bus, or by a combination of these. Every single road I have ever seen throughout the city had a generously wide bike path on the side, and some roads were explicitly made for bikes. I very seldom had to get somewhere that was more than a 10-minute walk from the nearest bus or train station, but when I did, it was easily fixed by just taking my bike on the train with me and riding it from the station to my destination. Living in sunny, dry, and warm California, there are absolutely no excuses as to why there are so few bike accommodations. Denmark was rainy for about as many days as it is dry in California, and very cold and dark for the majority of the year; yet, there were no excuses to not using your bike. In Denmark we would say that “there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing”.
    <br><br>

I think another factor that helped Denmark switch to more sustainable transportation options were the insane prices of cars and gasoline. A new BMW, for example, could cost you over $430,000 dollars in Copenhagen, which is ridiculously high and obviously turns away many people right off the bat. Furthermore, I remember gas prices being around 12DKK per liter, or around 45DKK per gallon, which is about $6.50. Not to mention, parking was extremely scarce and expensive around the city. In comparison, an ungdomskort (student train pass) was approximately $50 (360DKK) per month to travel as much as you wanted on any type of public transportation within the city.  
    <br><br>

Of course, Denmark is a MUCH smaller (socialist) country than the United States, but they set a great example of how a transportation paradigm shift is 100% feasible. We just need the initiative to set the foundations for this shift.

This video does an excellent job at highlighting the importance of personal action and activism. Although there are some obstacles to changing our diet to be largely plant-based, it’s something we have a little more control over compared to other things. Other actions such as using reusable bags when going shopping and not buying single use plastics are examples of things we can somewhat easily control. It’s a lot harder to switch to an electric vehicle if you can’t afford to buy a new car or ride your bike to work everyday if you live in an area where doing so would seriously put your life in danger. I think if we addressed some of the social issues that prevent people from making environmentally conscious decisions, we would see much more of a reduction in our environmental footprint. 
     <br><br>
   In regards to the climate activism portion of the video, I love the Denmark example because it highlights the importance of activism even on the local level. Most people only think to be politically active in big elections but fail to realize that even a small scale change can have a global effect. The increase in biking as the main form of transportation in the Danish city mentioned saved 3.8 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions with 62% of people there biking. If more cities invested in the infrastructure to make biking safe, could you imagine the reduction in carbon emissions? Being politically active year round and voting for environmental policies would significantly impact the future climate and just how much it will change. With this, I definitely agree that we need a combination of personal action, climate activism, and political activity to accomplish the carbon emission reductions needed to stay below the 2 degree Celsius change.

It’s sort of sad that even if everyone on the planet starts to eat vegan, it still won’t be enough to help the Earth. I feel like there is little hope for the individual at this point in time. We just have to do our part, then sit back and hope the world changes for the better. It is surprising that ⅔ of the gas produced by the United States currently, is from fracking. Is this number going up, stationary, or going down? It is hard to imagine that a business that America is making so much money off of would ever completely shut down. It seems like there will always be people who are hungrier for money than the wellbeing of the planet. As I am writing this, I am riding a bus on my way back to school from a weekend in San Luis Obispo, and I am driving past multiple fracking machines. It is always interesting to see the topics you are learning about first hand, negative or positive. It is also helpful that I am learning all of this important information with the elections right around the corner. It will heavily influence my choices in voting this year.

It is essential that we take personal action if we actually want to see a change in the world. We cannot depend on others to do what we refuse to do. It is up to us to individually step up to the plate and start changing the way we live in order to help slow climate change. It is, however, to inform one’s self about the long term effects of whatever it is we decide to do to help. As mentioned in the video, simply changing our diets and essentially going vegan would not be enough. One of the most significant actions we can do is take the time to vote. We can vote for representatives who will address climate change and try to find solutions rather than simply deny it. After watching Ken’s video, I realized there many other things I can also do to slow down climate change. Its very admirable hearing the measures Ken is taking to do his part on this global issue. Riding a bike to and fro work can be very time consuming and exhausting, but there's sacrifices we must be willing to make if we want to see some real change.

After watching this video, I learned that personal actions can reduce my carbon footprint. But not everyone wants to change their way of life. Only a small number of people are willing to change themselves in order to protect the environment. The impact of individual actions on the global environment is very small, so voting can better let society realize our attention to the climate crisis. I think this is the most important point. Before, there were many solutions to solve the problem of climate change, because people did not pay attention to it and the government did not pass it for the sake of interests. Now we should convey our views on the climate crisis to the outside world in this way.

You are right. It's hard to guarantee that everyone in this country will change their way of life to improve the environment. There are many people who, for their own benefit, will be dismissive of global warming. However, I believe that in the future, more and more people have received higher education, and this phenomenon will be changed. More and more intellectuals are willing to help our earth become better.

Because it is hard to trust individuals to make lifestyle changes, people must use their political will to elect officials that will enact policy to FORCE lifestyle changes. We are all just part of a system, and if the system changes our behaviors will change with it. Humans need incentives to motivate their actions, and for many avoiding the climate crisis is not a sufficient incentive to change their actions because of the time delay of climate change. America needs to start throwing their weight around politically when it comes to the climate crisis. It is disgraceful that the US hasn't taken the lead on this issue seeing as we wield so much influence worldwide and could inspire/pressure other countries into doing the same. Instead, it is America who is lagging behind the rest of the world on this issue.

After learning about the Green New Deal and watching this lecture it is apparent how crucial it is for people to take the time out of their day to educate themselves on candidates from all levels of government and vote. To me, this is sort of the baseline responsibility that all eligible people should be doing. Some might find it intimidating or somewhat boring but I think it helps to talk about these things with friends and have discussions. By talking about it with others you are encouraging them to have some sort of awareness and also forces you to have enough evidence to back up your own opinions. 
     <br><br>

I like how Ken focused on the importance of activism and the relationship to biking infrastructure. IV and UCSB is obviously extremely bike-friendly and it has made me so much more aware of how other cities are accommodating of alternative transportation. I am frequently in Long Beach and just last year the downtown area's streets got reconfigured to accommodate protected bike lanes. While this was a win for bicyclists, many local residents and business owners protested the remodel because of the reduced street parking in the area. One of the candidates for a seat on district council organized a protest and hopes to change the current configuration or remove them altogether - lets hope he's unsuccessful. The situation in Long Beach highlights how important it is to vote not only in the presidential election but local ones as well.

Honestly, I wish we went into detail in-class about the political candidates for 2020 and each of their proposed plans for climate change. I know we have talked about Bernie, and I am pretty familiar with his plan, but I am pretty much in the dark regarding other candidates. Obviously, Trump is not the choice regarding climate change, and Pelosi seemed to lean towards inaction on the vox documentary. Even if it was just one lecture where we went: AOC- Green New Deal, Bernie - public transport, bloomberg-... Not necessarily endorse any of these candidates but just do a compare and contrast on all of their plans and how they plan to fund them.

I love the prospective here of taking a bike especially to places that are relatively close. The possibility of bikes that are powered and are able to go at decent speeds is definitely enticing. I made the argument last time that the incentive to take a train over a plane is simply. not worth the inconvenience in time too many people. This situation, however, is definitely something I think will be easier for people to switch too. I also believe that with well established bike paths, we can increase the bike speed limit, and creators can innovate even more to make bike travel that much faster. In addition, if many were to switch to using bikes, it would theoretically reduce traffic on the freeways, and this in turn will allow these cars that must be on the road to get better mpg and waste less fuel. In a sense, peoples switching to bikes would have many great incentives that trickle further beyond its surface solution. I hope that our bike infrastructure as well as innovation develops greatly in the near future because not only would this greatly help the environment, but also I think this would be a new, fun way to travel and get places over sitting in hours of traffic in a car.

I am also a great fanatic of the increased use of bicycles in all settings. The promotion of bicycle use through the spiked price of parking in college campus parking structures exhibits a positive impact on the local environment. Bike infrastructure, like you suggest, will be quite the investment, but the benefits nearly dominate the negatives. The car industry will be forced to have a tight turn around in reconsidering their innovations with higher bicycle presence on the roads. Car companies can continue to consider technologies that are resourceful and recycle common waste items and hopefully reduce and/or alleviate the amount of carbon emissions. I’m not entirely sure about increasing bike speeds, as I do trust they are enforced to be so for safety, but I do agree with definitely being creative in providing safe open space for bikers to commute.

I greatly appreciate that Ken kept reminding us all to not lose sight of the "gorilla in the room", meaning fossil fuels and the corporations that continue to use fossil fuels. There are times where I feel frustrated when people micromanage environmental movements and boil it down to personal actions. For instance, when plastic straws were gaining more attention in the media, everyone swore off plastic straws and began to use reusable straws. While this is a solid adjustment and got more people to steer away from single-use plastic, this is a small issue in a mountain of problems amongst this climate crisis. Personal changes, without a doubt, make a difference, but political change is what will have the greatest impact to solve this crisis.

     <br><br>

Ken spent a solid amount of this lecture discussing Copenhagen and mentioned their surge in bike usage as an example of political activism making a change. Local politicians were convinced to change bike lanes along busy streets, which provided more opportunities for citizens to commute via bike. Hearing that this prevents 3.8 billion tons of CO2 from being emitted in the air is incredibly inspiring to hear, and I hope that the US can follow in Copenhagen's footsteps. I do understand that I can do more than just hope for this change, however, and I am now inspired to engage more politically. I am now at the age to vote, which is incredibly exciting as voting is one of the most important things for someone to do. I've felt like I've been on the sidelines of democracy and policy for far too long, but now I can finally enact some change and do my part in reversing this crisis.

I agree. Personal action is necessary and good, but it is not the way to move forward. Whether we like it or not, we live in a society and as such all of the power is held in a majority. I think that the biggest personal contribution one can make to the climate crisis is to convince another to follow suit. If we really want to prevent this catastrophe, we must collectively work together to undo all of the damage that our collective splurging over the past century has caused.

In my hometown, the only bike lane was a scenic route along the beach. Very pretty and beautiful but by no means practical. There weren't even shoulder bike lanes. Living here at UCSB has honestly showed me how it is possible to live without ever needing a car. Just the other week I had a very awkward conversation with my parents where I was like: 'Yeah, I am going to have a parking spot at the house next year, but no I don't need my car and am not bringing it over." Those are words I never thought I would say, but here I am. Overall, I feel blessed to live among such a proactive community. Next year I will be studying abroad in Europe and really hope I get to visit Copenhagen, especially if I can get there through high speed rail.
<br><hr>

I really wanted to say that I completely agree with you comments about corporations needing to make the change to be able to make a substantial difference. Sure, the individuals affect on the environment is still something but nothing compared to big businesses. A thought I had however, is if every person had the mentality that "oh my actions have no huge affect anyways," then we would have some serious problems. If enough people can be more willing to make change sin their lives, changes can be made in society and the environment. 
     <br><br>
That all being said, the individual does not have nearly as big impact as corporations and business do. I mean if bigger businesses were willing to make some changes to the way their company produced and processed certain materials, the impact on the environment would be substantially decreased. The problem with these businesses and the corporations, is money. Each company wants to maximize its profit and do not want to compromise or allow other companies to succeed over them. Its is frustrating that these companies could do so much to help the environment, but refuse to do so because they do not want to lose any money.

This video showed me that the littlest details or actions can make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things. I already knew the importance of voting but I didn't think about the little things when it comes to who to vote for. For example, I never thought that whether or not a candidate is committed to the improvement of bike infrastructure would influence my decision. This year will be my first opportunity to vote and I'm excited to make a difference. Something that I thought of throughout this video is that biking to work or school needs to become cool or desirable. Ken mentioned that he was laughed at when he first started taking an E-bike to school many years ago. I think that many people would not ride a bike to school if this was the case. Here at UCSB, I wouldn't say bikes are cool, but they're definitely accepted. No one ever laughs at someone for riding a bike to class. If this became the case nationwide or even statewide it could make a huge difference as Ken noted. This along with voting for those who support the improvement of bike infrastructure is the way to go. I know in my hometown it's pretty intimidating to ride a bike. All the bike lanes are just a shoulder on the side of the road. I have personally witnessed a biker get hit and multiple close calls. Even with an improved infrastructure, I wouldn't see a majority of the population switching to biking. It's for this reason I think both voting for those whop will improve infrastructure AND somehow making biking cool and desirable is necessary for this change in culture.

This was also my biggest take away. Although I started with the feeling that dismissing personal action as unimportant in the grand scheme of climate change was damaging and counterproductive, I understand the point that we don't have enough time for small personal actions being the only thing we do. Now if we put more effort into personal actions, such as attending a rally/protest, researching candidates before voting, and educating and advocating climate activism to others, this may help the bigger goals like imprving infrastructure that allow for personal action to be done on a larger scale (going from students in IV biking to UCSB to 2/3 of SB biking to work/school). 
     <br><br>
The only problem I pose is that sometimes it is difficult, time consuming, and confusing to research all voting candidates and politics/policy behind climate change in order to engage in being politically active. Especially in the last presidential term, and the readings/videos for this class exemplify, fact checking is so important. For me to research each candidates position on climate change and its surrounding issues, past positions on such issues, and fact checking what they say– it would take a lot of effort and time to do so. And because it's hard for me to find news outlets that do a good job in being unbiased and explain nuanced arguments, it can feel overwhelming. Any tips or sources anyone knows of, please feel free to point me to!

After watching this lecture, I realized that I do not have that much knowlege about politics. I really don’t know any politcians and what there motives are. With lack of knowlege, I have no motive to vote. I also think that it is just one vote so it will not make big of a diffrence. But, now I think I should give political knowlege a chance because it could be interesting. I could also tell other people to vote for the politicans that support climate change. Also in this lecture I really like the bike example. I use a skate board and I feel that it is very useful. Maybe even better then bikes. I do not have to lock it because it is always with me and you can take it anywhere because its smaller on the bike. You can take it on a bus and then ride it to your destination which is very good for the enviroment.

After watching this week’s lecture video, I began to think of the things that I do that help the current climate crisis. For starters, ever since leaving for college in 2018, I have not driven a car. This is because I understand how bad the driving situation is here in Santa Barbara. Due to this, I solely walk and bike to get around here. Although admittedly, this decision to drive was mainly derived from not wanting to drive due to the circumstances I’m in, I always stop to realize how much less carbon dioxide I am emitting compared to my driving self. In addition, biking in Santa Barbara is way more friendly than in places in Los Angeles, as Los Angeles has way less designated biking lanes compared to Santa Barbara. Thinking about this makes me further think about other things that I can do to help the planet. For starters, I can take shorter showers. Doing so will save so much water. In addition, I can slowly start to ween myself off an animal-based diet. The past seven weeks in this class has made me very self-conscious whenever I eat a burger or anything else animal-derived.

I also reflected on my lifestyle choices after watching this video, and agree with you that my main means of transportation here in santa barbara have been by walking and biking. This is something I am proud of, especially after learning about how much of an impact driving has on our planet. There’s definitely a lot more I could be doing, though. As you brought up, I am also trying to ease my way into a more plant-based diet. I’ve grown up my entire life eating meat so this is more of a challenge for me, but one I think is important to overcome overtime if I want to consider myself a true environmentalist. I think a lot of people don’t realize how much of a positive change could be to our planet if we all decided to change our lifestyle habits for the better, which is why I’m aiming to do what I can and help others as well.

I enjoyed this lecture more than most, as it provided insight to the magnitude of effect out actions could take. I also enjoyed hearing about Ken’s personal habits and actions. I am impressed that Ken is willing to bike every day from downtown Santa Barbara to UCSB given that many students I have interacted with are unwilling to go a couple miles without driving their car. I personally do not have a bike with me this year, but rarely go too far. I always walk to class and find it much more relaxing than the process of driving and finding parking. If I am going somewhere a bit further away, I will take the bus. Though the bus system is not too reliable, it serves my needs in getting me to a destination in a relatively predictable time frame. 
     <br><br>
Personally, I do not believe I will go far beyond taking positive personal actions. I am way too selfish and non-vocal to become any type of activist. Although I see the benefits of advocating for safer bike lanes or other possibilities in combating climate change, I simply do not really see my self doing it. At least, not in the near future. Possibly after I graduate, I may find more time to commit towards climate activism, but in my current situation I am not motivated to become a climate activist. 
     <br><br>
I have never been too politically involved besides voting. I have participated in every presidential and midterm election I have been eligible to vote in, but other than that I have not really done anything in the political sphere. I have never had any motivation to contact a local political figure or spread political views. 
     <br><br>
Clearly, all three are beneficial to combating the climate crisis. If successful, I believe that activism and being politically active can create much greater changes that result in much greater impacts in saving the planet. I will continue to constantly improve my personal actions and hope that I will be able to contribute in some way to activism and politics.

I really like that in this lecture, Ken gave us the example of Copenhagen and how it's a bottom-up process in terms of transforming their transportation system, which shows that normal people like us, who cares enough and who are willing to be vocal about it, can bring about big changes.

     <br><br>

However, I do understand your point of view in that I can see how difficult it can be to become more involved politically since it is something that can require a lot of time and commitment, and given how fast-paced and hectic life as a university student can be, it is easy for many of us to be occupied or distracted with things that seem more urgent, like homework or opening a notification on our phones since those things tend to be more in-your-face than climate change.

After watching the lecture, I found the shift from cars to bikes in Copenhagen particularly inspiring. I believe that most places could also achieve that change, as long as there is the political backing and push from citizens to do so. Right now in most places in the United States, biking is not the most ideal or safe mode of transportation for people. Where I’m from (the bay area) there is a bike lane on most roads, but the bike lane is always very narrow and right next to the right lane of cars. This makes it hard for cars to see bikers sometimes, especially if they are trying to right, and the lane is, generally speaking, quite unsafe. The roads there also have a lot of cars, so if you are not very good at biking or have not biked in a long time, biking would be very dangerous. Thus, many people choose to take cars, adding drastically to our total carbon emissions. However, if we can work towards safer and more efficient bike lanes (like in Copenhagen) I think more people would be willing to switch from cars to bikes which would greatly lower carbon emissions, creating a big positive impact. 
      <br><br>
Another thing that was addressed that I find very important is educated voting. There is a lot of propaganda and advertising attempting to influence people into voting for various political candidates. Sometimes, these advertisements don’t speak the full truth. It is our responsibility as voters to make sure we are supporting the right cause and be able to look past the facade these government officials are attempting to portray to us. We have the power to make change, and we should do so responsibly. By taking the time to research candidates before deciding to vote for them, we can exercise our political rights to create a lasting impact.

You mentioned the conditions and safety of biking in the Bay Area, and it just made me think how could we encourage the general public into biking more. In the case of Copenhagen, people pushed the governors to modify roads so that they become biking-friendly whereas in the U.S., the biking culture isn't so big and there's nobody pushing local governments to build bike paths because everybody just uses their cars. If the government really does make biking safer for people, would people even care to try out commuting on bikes when the car culture is so embedded in the society? Perhaps the government could provide subsidy with bike purchases (regular/electric) after improving the conditions but there's still no guarantee. These are just some of my thoughts and questions...

I think there’s so much that can be learned from the success story in Copenhagen. Their citizens understood and mitigated the consequences coming form their carbon foot print. It’s inspiring to real legislative changes becoming implemented after collective activism. I believe practical and personal changes to be most effective for the environment, more so than something like the green new deal. The us government was created in a way that prevents the rise of unpopular policies or radical changes through checks and balances in addition to the separation of powers. As a result, something like the green new deal has no chance as long as there’s a whole party opposing its core principles. Therefore, rather than expecting the government to change radically and quickly, something the US government naturally doesn’t do, we as citizens of the planet need to do what’s in our individual capacities. Therefore, individual lifestyle changes should be in focus and our participation will be essential in making any considerable effects for the better. A cultural change doesn’t happen in unison and there are those individuals who will serve as the examples of the future. I think leading by example makes others much more inclined to pay attention. Someone asking and wondering why I’m vegan might be much more interested in hearing about the effects of meat on the environment than someone who’s talking to me as we’re both enjoying steak.

I agree with your point about “practical and personal changes to be most effective for the environment, more so than something like the green new deal. “ because it is more realistic to set high expectations for yourself than the legislators of the United States government.  The climate crisis is by far an extremely important issue for our world today, if not the most important one for the entirety of the world’s population.  The problem with the Green New Deal and the demands it presents to the US government is that they are unpractical relative to the other issues American politicians have to solve and should solve immediately.  
       <br><br>
For example, generational poverty has been plaguing certain demographics in the United States for hundreds of years.  To pool countless amounts of resources to an issue like the climate crisis instead of helping our own citizens out of poverty would be negligent, seeing as their economic status has been stagnant for a longer period of time than the climate crisis has even been a crisis.
      <br><br>
 If you want the average American to care about the climate crisis and to furthermore support things like the Green New Deal, the average American can’t be poor and struggling to make ends meet on a day-to-day basis.

I enjoyed this lecture particularly because of what Ken mentioned about the bike culture in Denmark. As somebody who has lived in a European country all her life and has visited many others, I can say from experience that bikes are a lot more integrated into our everyday life than her in America. Especially in the city centers, there are bike paths everywhere and it has become more and more common to bike instead of drive. Some cities have even made it part of their tourist attraction - like Amsterdam. It is probably one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world and I have never seen so many bikes parked in front of apartment buildings as I did in Amsterdam. When I visited a few summers ago, one of the first things everybody told us to do was rent a bike. I really wish America would encourage bike use the way that so many European cities do. It is not just about helping our climate, it is beneficial to our health too and often a lot faster and more efficient. Additionally, most European cities have an excellent public transport system, another thing that the US lacks. 
      <br><br>
This is why I believe that voting - especially in the United States - is one of the most important things you can do to fight for climate justice. Many of the things Ken has mentioned over the past few weeks - like biking instead of driving, taking the train instead of flying - are relatively easy to implement if you live in Europe. Not so much in America. Often, this country simply lacks the necessary infrastructure and tools to help people reduce their carbon footprint. If there are no proper bike paths and barely any efficient train connections, how are you supposed to switch to these environmentally friendly actions? If the public transport system is unreliable, unsanitary and inefficient, then nobody will ever voluntarily stop using their cars! The solution is to vote for politicians that will actually make a change regarding all these issues that prevent Americans from becoming more ecofriendly. Sure, you can become vegan. but like Ken mentioned in this lecture, that is not nearly enough. Many things are simply out of our hands, so we need people in positions of power that can make those changes that we can't. We as "ordinary citizens" can only do so much. There comes a point where we have to rely on our government to help fight against this climate crisis with us. Thus, we need to vote for people who will do exactly that.
      <br><br>
I am not an American citizen, I can do very little to change the US right now. So please, everybody who DOES have the opportunity to vote, please do! We are responsible for our future.

In today’s lecture video, professor Ken talked that only doing personal actions are not enough to solve the entire problem. We also need to act personally but influence the bigger picture. He presented the most effective ways of doing this is by vote and activism and gave the example that Copenhagen successfully transformed its transportation from cars to bicycles, which reduce an incredible amount of emissions.
      <br><br>

The use of the bicycle reminds me of what the reading “Green New Deal” said that we need to improve and develop public transportation as well. I think this is also an important cultural step, that driving a var doesn’t mean that you are successful or rich, neither taking bus or subways means that you are poor. Public transportation does not only solve the problems of gas use and emission. What I am thinking is that it save more places for the city. If we use cars, we need lots of parking lots. If we use public transportation, we only need bus stations in the entire city. We can use this amount of space to do so many things, like gardening and broaden the pavements. There would be more plants in the city for beauty and fresh air. There would be more beautiful and wider woad for people. At that time I think people will be motivated to walk to near places instead of driving. This change of environment and circumstances near where people are living can unconsciously change the people treated the city. They could treat the city like a factory where all they have to do is work there, or they can treat the city like a garden where they need to protect, so this secretly imbues an idea to people that we need to protect the environment. 
      <br><br>


In conclusion, support for environmental protection is important and it contributes to future generations.

What I really enjoyed about this lecture is that Ken is very honest; he is very blunt of the idea that people switching to a plant-based diet is just unfeasible. To convert everyone into a vegan or a vegetarian is very unlikely, and doing personal actions as such - although it makes you feel better - will not really solve anything. This goes back to the idea of the tragedy of the commons. We are all using the resources right now, but if one person changes their dietary habits, it is not like climate change is going to be stopped. Yes, every person and every step matters. However, we are in a time of dire urgency and the only changes that are going to make a big enough impact in order to help combat climate change is the ones that hit the biggest emitters of carbon emission. 
      <br><br>


If we look at how the greenhouse gas corporations really affect the budget and funding that politicians receive, you would probably understand why a lot of the policies work in favor of these industries. It is like if someone paid you $3 million to just agree with them; it is not that hard. That is the problem. We have found that we are continuously placed into situations where hush money makes it easy to ignore the problems that we currently face; it makes it easy to put aside the policies of improving our climate and just going about our regular economy as if the world is not burning around us. 

      <br><br>

I think today, we really need to try and improve how our industries influence our policies. But, in the time in which we need to improve the climate, the corruption and games within our government are just not going to change. So, I think what I would propose to create more coalitions that fund politicians to take the opposite policy; to come together as Americans by changing government with money. It is extremely naive to think that our system is not being run by money and that money could not sway the decision. Activism won’t work, but bank accouts will.

This lecture made me understand how out daily actions can affect the climate in various ways, and also out daily actions’ true values. One of the most powerful point in the lecture is that even if every single person on the planet becomes vegan, it would still not be nearly enough to mitigate the climate crisis. This really made me think about my daily actions’ various energy consumption. The lecture also made me realize that political participation such as voting, and activism regarding the environment are very powerful, as they’re the two primary ways our voices can be heard by the government; these two things should be considered when we are discussing ways of mitigating the climate changes.

I was also surprised at the fact that even if everyone ate a vegan diet, it would still not be enough to make an impact on the climate change. This was shocking to me as this whole time I was thinking that eating less to no meat was the biggest contribution that I could make for our planet. Knowing that beef production accounts for less than 30 percent of methane emission makes me realize that the other 70 percent from practices such as fracking is where we need to focus our attention. Biking is a great way to lower methane released into the atmosphere. I was very shocked to hear that 60 percent of people in Copenhagen bike to work or school everyday. That is so amazing to me and at first very hard to believe. I was thinking about my parents and their commute to work and I thought there is no way they could even do that because there is no safe bike lanes or bike route that they could even ride on. If local governments could pass bills that implement more bike lanes or bike paths then I believe that people would be more motivated to ride their bikes. However, we have to take into account climates that aren't similar to Santa Barbara. We are lucky enough to live in a city with some of the best weather in the country. It is very practical for me to ride my bike to class everyday and I do. However, it is 14 degrees in Mankato, Minnesota and a student who goes to Minnesota State University probably won't be riding their bike to class. However, in places like LA where people are driving everywhere and probably has one of the top emissions from cars, implementing a bike commute could be more practical.

It's true, we will be reliant on fossil fuels for decades to come.  There is an issue with the claim to end fracking.  Fracking gets us natural gas, which produces 50-60 percent less CO2 than coal and oil.  The methane released from fracking only accounts for 1-10 percent of the entire emissions of a fracking site, and usually it is below 3%.  While this is not a clean solution, and is not what we want to rely on in the future, fracking is the energy we need to use to transition us from a fossil fuel economy to renewable energy.  It is naive and dangerous to believe we can just stop using fossil fuels as almost all of the luxuries we have rely on them.  Another benefit to fracking is that the US can be completely self-reliant with natural gas.  This will allow us to pull out of the middle east to protect our oil resources, and renegotiate trade deals that benefit American citizens.  In these trade deals, we could demand other countries to invest in climate research and solving climate change.  If we ban fracking, we will continue to rely on the middle east to help power our country, forcing us into the undesirable geopolitical situation we are currently in.

While hearing that doing such a simple thing as building bike paths can help play a role in solving the climate crisis, it is disheartening to know that we haven't made significant progress towards such a simple solution. If our country is unwilling to build some bike paths, which I'm assuming is not very expensive nor does it negatively impact anyone, who's to say we would make progress towards a solution that is much more expensive and will negatively impact some people in the short term. It's also not surprising seeing this progress in countries other than the U.S. I feel like at one point, the United States really was one of the best countries in the world; a country interested in doing what is best for its citizens. In the past two decades, however, other nations have greatly surpassed us in that light. We have stopped making progress towards ensuring a sustainable lifestyle for our population which is honestly sad and disappointing.

I have always thought there needs to be individual change in coordination with collective action. I do not think that individuals alone can make drastic system changes, but if the individuals in a collective are not willing to change, then nothing will be done after revolutionary action. With motivated trail blazing individuals, it is easier to motivate others and to create a movement. The inspiration that is created by the trailblazers and the dissatisfaction with the state should be enough to mobilize people in a meaningful way.
       <br><br>

I also agree that voting is crucial to enacting change. Younger generations need to turn out to vote to have any chance to overthrow the old guard that resists change. I think voting can sometimes be written off as unimportant because it does not happen super frequently and when it does locally there is not as much commotion about it. I am so glad that this has changed since I have come to Santa Barbara. A major effort on campus has been made to get as many people as possible registered to vote and a lot of people my age seem very eager to go out to the polls. I hope that this same energy is being spread around nationally as our next election is an especially important one.
      <br><br>
 
I would also agree that getting a large number of people to make small changes  1) not only has more impact over all but also 2) is usually easier to convince people to do. Going back to last week's video, I think we need a climate vanguard to guide others towards climate friendly tendencies. Once people get involved I think it could create a snowball effect and suddenly a nationwide change in behavior has occurred; that's huge.

I agree with you that we can change government and policy by voting. But I don't think it is realistic to just vote. Ken mentioned that the people who are aware of environmental issues like us are the younger generation. However, two-thirds of the votes are in the hands of the older generation who are not aware of environmental issues. As young people, our influence is limited, and we are certainly not as powerful as the older generation.
      <br><br>
However, Ken suggested that the use of new technologies to replace gasoline cars would be feasible. With the advance of technology, renewable energy such as solar energy and wind energy is becoming more and more complete, and costs will also be reduced. I believe that one day they will replace electricity as the most popular energy source.

This lecture really solves some of my confuses about whether my personal actions can have an impact on climate change. According to Ken, these three aspects, being activist, voting, and taking personal actions, are interrelated, so we should not see the thing only from one aspect. And the personal example of Ken cycling to UCSB reminds me of the traffic and road conditions I experienced here. The bike lanes, or just to call it a narrow area segregated by painted white lines, are terrible with few people biking through, and due to the fact that the car speed in CA is really fast, it will be too dangerous to bike along or near some of the road corners where drivers could have dead zone noticing those bikers. Also, for the example of Copenhagen, I have a strong attachment because I have once been to Danmark when I was really young, and that means I didn’t actually get to know neither Danmark is a city of environmental protection nor its famous biking culture. However, the city still left me with a strong impression of ppl biking everywhere, on different bikes, in diversified costumes, and to different places around the country. This lecture answers the question I’ve been asking since the last visit to Copenhagen and I’m pretty sure I will never forget how intriguing the experience has left me.

While I understand wanting to reduce your own carbon footprint, it is important to remember that in order to actually affect the environment, everyone would have to reduce their carbon footprint collectively. To rely solely on personal action:  limiting your own life and inconveniencing yourself simply to make yourself feel less guilty, seems very impractical because the time and energy spent to change lightbulbs, not fly, and avoid common foods could be spent on political action and climate activism, which I believe to be much more effective and time efficient in regards to climate change awareness and mitigation. Personal action in actuality, virtually has no effect on the environment. If everyone was willing to make the changes necessary, then personal action would be able to solve everything, however, this is not the case, so we must focus on creating new policy that directs the general public into a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Some examples of this would be as opposed to telling everyone to use public transportation, something extremely inconvenient and even dangerous thing to do, the pressure should be put on local governments creating better public transportation infrastructure, until it becomes more convenient to use public transportation than the use of a combustion engine car.

I enjoyed listening to the story of the changes that activism in Copenhagen acquired. We can learn from this successful example. The citizens of Copenhagen recognized the detrimental effects that their climate footprint was having, and enough of them were able to convince local legislation to make large changes. It’s amazing that ⅔ of people bike for transportation. Realistically, this is much more feasible than having a car, since most are going across town at most to work or school. Common values were powerful enough to enact this reduction of emissions, which has started a snowball effect in Denmark. 
      <br><br>
I think one of the reasons why Americans feel defeated by the climate crisis is because they doubt the power of their voice. Many of us have helpful intentions, we just need to trust in our personal practice and popularize the values that will benefit communities and the planet. This will alert politicians who want our votes. 
      <br><br>
Our personal efforts do make a difference, but our greatest contribution is to vote. The citizens of Copenhagen show us what we could be capable of.

I also found the story about Copenhagen to be a compelling example. Seeing how an already developed city like theirs was able to integrate better bike infrastructure into their city makes the task of doing so not seem that bad. It was comforting to hear that their movement towards more bike use all started with climate activism and that this movement has grown big enough to have 62% of the population using bikes in their daily commutes. Sometimes, when thinking about how one can make an impact on the climate crisis, you can start to feel very insignificant in the matter. Realistically, most people don’t have a direct influence on the fossil fuel industry or the political power to enact carbon taxes or emission restrictions on animal agriculture. For many, this feeling even makes them doubt their voice in voting. Last night, my roommate and I were discussing the upcoming primary election and she explained that she doesn’t think her one vote is going to make a difference on who wins. Statistically, she’s probably right, but I fear that many people feel this same way and thus a large portion of people don’t care to vote because they don’t think they’ll make a difference. But when a large group of eligible voters fails to vote, it creates a large shift in the voting pool that can have a drastic effect on who wins or what proposition is passed. Historically, many citizens of our age range, 18-25, don’t vote. So imagine the power we could have in the election process if our generation showed up and voted for candidates who advocate for climate action. 

      <br><br>

Ken’s lecture also put a huge emphasis on climate activism as one of the most important ways we can make a difference. Going back to the Copenhagen example, their movement to improve bike infrastructure all started with climate activists who rallied and petitioned for change. By coming together and putting pressure on the government, they were able to actually induce change. The use of social activism has also been proven effective through history with movements such as the civil rights and women’s rights movements. I think that right now we’re neglecting to utilize activism to its full potential. Sure we’re rallying in big cities and picket-fencing the White House, but there’s got to be so much more than we can do witch activism beyond that. For example what about starting movements through social media or getting hashtags trending that encourage sustainability. Social media is such a wide-reaching network that something like that could reach communities across the world.

<br><hr>
I agree with Sarah; I also very much enjoyed Ken’s discussion of Copenhagen’s bicycle transformation. This is a model that proves the potential of climate activism. As Sarah notes, the citizens of Copenhagen recognized what the damage they were inflicting to the climate and decided to do something about it. The transformation that took place in Copenhagen was caused by the citizens and by the citizens alone. It is amazing that ordinary people were able to bring about this type of change and it should be inspiring to people across our country and the rest of the world. I also enjoyed reading Sarah’s second point, that Americans feel defeated by the climate crisis because they do not trust in the power of their voice. I think Sarah is right; I think that many Americans have the right intentions and the right ideas. We just need to get these people to use their ideas to actually achieve reform.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your response.  I love where you state the reality proven in the Copenhagen example, that the snowball effect caused by common sense is enough to fuel incredible change.  It baffles me how the United States, thought to be one of the most developed countries in the world, has yet to have this wake up call.  Although the prospect of having to make monumental changes on the majority of established society is daunting, in order to stop or at least minimize the effects of climate change real policies have to be established and the world turned on its head.  And this needs to be addressed now, because the 2024 election might be too late.  Like you said, each person’s vote has much more power than we think.  Policy can be changed through the vote of every individual.  I think a reason for this is how easy it is to feel like one vote doesn't matter in a country of 300 million, and while this statement is fairly depressing, if everyone voted there could be more change than ever thought possible.  We are capable of much more than we are putting forth.

It's so interesting how we always forget about the smallest of issues that could create the biggest impact. I'm not surprised by the topic of this video just given past experiences with Ken's support for bikes, however before taking this class I probably never really would have ever considered the importance of biking. I mean, I always hear about the small ways you can reduce your emissions and water usage, you know, the classic ones such as taking shorter showers, turning the lights off when you leave a room, or keeping temperatures reasonable in your house. Driving less and riding bikes was always part of this grouping, but I also feel as though it was also always something to be overlooked. Or, at least I definitely overlooked it. It seemed to ridiculous, like yes, that's a cute thought but how could it possibly be viable when travelling longer distances. Clearly, as Ken mentions, there are electric bikes. Maybe you only go 28 mph, but still that's pretty fair for a bike. Besides, there are just so many more benefits; it's a relatively small object to make, at least in comparison to cars, you can avoid traffic, and it really isn't that much work but it's still a workout.

      <br><br>

So, taking action in policies is clearly essential to solving this issue, but you have to consider the smaller aspects too and remember to bring that to people's attention, something as small as making better suited bike lanes. It's crucial that we make small changes and make waves in order to make officials know and make global changes.

I do agree with the idea of biking and using this as a main form of transportation to help the change. While I do agree with Ken’s statement as just voting to give your time and chance to change. Being active in voting I realize is a positive form of environmental justice and using your voice with a vote. The combination of this, eating a plant based diet, and other forms we’ve talked about before are going to be the answers to fixing the climate crisis. I do find it very interesting and supportive that Ken is riding his E-bike to work and back because that is in fact leading by example. I genuinely have wondering what his form of transportation to school was, and this 100% ensures his care and movement for the cause. It’s very inspiring and persuasive to lead by example and make that change. I do think biking overall can be a huge change like mentioned in Copenhagen. This simple change by everyone around the world can be and ultimate change and revolution that we are going to need.

At the beginning of the lecture I couldn't help but feel a bit discouraged. Throughout this course I have learned a lot of different things that I can do in order to reduce my carbon footprint, week after week I read articles, watched videos, and listened to these lectures which have led me to change a lot of my personal habits. So hearing that changing my diet doesn't help THAT much kind of sucks, but I know its the truth. Hearing that even if everyone changed their diet it still wouldn't make that much of a difference also sucked. It's just frustrating that even if we make our own personal changes and encourage others to do so as well, there really isn't a lot we can do for climate change on our own. After hearing Ken talk about his bike, I am interested in learning more about them. However, I agree that the bike "lanes" are just not practical or safe enough. In my hometown, all the bike paths are just on the side of the road, very close to traffic.I believe that voting is very important and everyone should take the opportunity to do so, this year I even got my mother and father to vote whom have never before done so!




</p><hr>



<p>

I’m a strong believer that being politically active is the best thing that you can do in order to take steps toward solving any issue. Especially climate change. Like Ken mentioned, if everyone adopted a plant based diet it would not be enough to stop climate change. If everyone stopped flying tomorrow it would only reduce two percent of all emissions. The most drastic personal actions can be made, and they still aren’t as vital of a contribution as voting can be. Putting people in office that will fight for solutions we need and resist the lobbying power of the fossil fuel industry is the only way true progress will be achieved. If people hadn’t used their voting power to put AOC on office, the Green New Deal, the closest thing we have to a plan towards becoming a carbon neutral country, likely wouldn’t exist yet. However, a very small percentage of people vote, and an even smaller percentage of people vote in the primaries. It is easy to not involve yourself in politics and it is definitely much less stressful to fade into the day to day of your life. Not exercising your right to vote only hurts yourself, though. By exercising inaction, you are showing everyone that you don’t want your voice to be heard, and are giving them permission to roll over things that you care about, like the climate.



</p><hr>



<p>
Out of those three options, I believe climate activism is the most important thing you can do for the climate. With climate activism, one can inform people of all that is happening, which many people do not know about the real facts, or the real information that politicians do not give to us. By educating people, more people care about this vital topic and therefore also take action. It can also make them take individual action, which when combined, makes a bigger impact than just one person alone. 
       <br><br>
Personal action also is important, because even though one person can make only so much of an impact, it is still an impact and a tiny amount of carbon that isn’t released into the environment. Also with climate activism, one could get other people to also change their lifestyle and live a much greener life, that benefits both them and the environment. \
      <br><br>
Climate activism can also cause many people to become politically active and vote for the people who support changing our lifestyles to save the planet.  Thiscan make the biggest impact, if politicians stick to their promises and pursue a greener lifestyle for America in general.

I totally agree that activism is the most important thing to do, because making others aware of the situation allows us to make real big changes. If we just stick to doing our own thing and making changes in our own personal lives, which is also good, we won't get as much change as is needed. I wish the news outlets and just people in general would talk more about climate change, because I feel like it's not addressed enough. If we spread awareness for the issue and suggest ways to solve it, more people will make lifestyle changes and vote against harming the environment. Doing things on your own is good, but it's important to remember that this is a shared effort.


<br><hr>
Your point in regard to climate activism being an essential role in combating climate change is completely valid in my opinion. Although one person adjusting their lifestyle into an eco-friendly one is helpful in at least a little bit, the real change begins when the majority of the people adjust. This is why climate change activism is important. The more people are aware of the issue and informed in how to help, the greater the effort in combating climate change is and the more impactful it is. For instance, the bicycling infrastructure will only be improved once people ask for it. Thus, it is important to inform people about the benefits that come from bicycling instead of using a car as the main mode of transportation. This way more people will be inclined to use a bicycle which will cause funds to be funneled toward bicycling infrastructure. And, once bicycling infrastructure is improved, more people will be inclined to use it since it is now safer. Taking this into account, one can see how activism plays an essential role in fighting climate change since it is the first step in a cycle of environmental improvements.

I completely agree with Ken. Starting with personal actions will keep us reminded about the issue we are fighting for and encourage us to keep doing what we can. Going vegan/vegetarian or riding the bus instead of driving a car can also be a way to inspire others to do the same. I see it as looking at a mirror and seeing that the change is possible because others are doing it. These personal changes can also lead to people becoming politically active because they are committed to the issue and want the change to be reflected in their daily lives.
      <br><br>


Starting at the local level can lead other cities to follow in their footsteps and eventually an entire state to do so. If California was able to change transportation from cars to bikes, it would definitely be a step in the right direction because surely other states would follow their lead. We just have to get to the polls to vote in politicians and vote on laws that will make theory into practice. It is important to note that not everyone is able to vote because of restriction or simply because they have work and are unable to make time. I feel like voting should be a national event where people do not have to work that day to maximize voter turnout. Of course, this is probably a systematic issue put in place to ensure that those that are disadvantaged (people of color, women, lower-income individuals, etc…) are not able to participate in this fundamental way of making their voices heard in government. 
      <br><br>


It is amazing to see Copenhagen being able to accomplish making a switch of more than half of people to taking bikes instead of cars. This gives me hope that it is possible and we just need to get on it. It will be a challenge for us to overcome, but it is something we must fight for.

Yeah I completely agree with what you said about personal actions. This is about cultural change, and it is not easy to make it happen. So if more people are taking initiatives, more people are likely to grow their awareness and follow up, and turn individual actions to collective actions. Even for me, though I really want to make personal contributions to help save the planet, it is nearly impossible for me to give up eating meat completely in just one day. It would be so much easier for me to adjust my diet if there is a friend who would like to do this together with me. And don't forget that there are a number of people, especially the older generation, don't want to change anything even if they know about the consequences.  

      <br><br>

I like the point that Ken made on how "activism, voting, and personal action can be – and very often are – intimately related." The example of Copenhagen is truly wonderful. It becomes a perfect proof that tells us individual actions, being politically active, voting for pro-bike policies, joining grassroots campaigns can actually work and cause huge positive change in a city. Copenhagen is responsible for keeping 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 or equivalent gasses from being released into the atmosphere each year. Just think about how much emission we can prevent if cities in the U.S. can adopt similar policies.

<p>
I have been waiting for the portion of the class where Ken mentions taking political action. I really like that he has introduced taking political action in such a small and seemingly do-able way: advocating for bikes. This is much less scary and much more realistic than say, trying to overthrow the government. Either way, I am a part of the 3.5% of people that it takes to create largely impactful change within our government– I will vote and advocate for the big and the small steps that we can take towards living sustainably in the US. 
      <br><br>


I find myself increasingly upset that we do not have adequate public transportation infrastructure available to us, nor do we have quality walking paths, and in most places bike paths are just a tiny slice of the road that is dominated by cars and trucks. I can get behind advocating for bike paths! Especially because post-manufacturing, there are no emissions! 
      <br><br>


Using your right to vote and supplementing it with attending a march or other activism activities can make huge differences in our way of life. Make sure you research your candidates, and if you receive literature from someone, make sure that you research the organization behind writing and distributing it. Use your vote wisely, or else it may be used against you.

I can relate with you when you said how advocating bikes is a really positive action that most, if not all, students at the university can partake in. Personally, I ride my bicycle everywhere whether it be the grocery store, class, and even going out at night. Unfortunately, I work 20 minutes away in downtown Santa Barbara so it would be really inconvenient to try and bike to work and make it there on time. I could choose to use public transportation which somewhat limits the amount of carbon emissions, but the stress of possibly showing up to work on time is too stressful. 
      <br><br>
Your point about using our rights to vote was also very true. I feel that sometimes we are caught up in the hype of voting for what our friends feel strongly about but we should take more time to consider what we really stand for.

After watching Ken‘s video, I think the methods mentioned in this article that we can use in our personal life to protect the environment and reduce carbon emissions are very effective. Compared with the previous political methods like the green new deal, the methods mentioned in the video that we can use really need to be practical, for example, we can try to reduce the number of For beef, which is a kind of meat, and then plants are added to the daily diet, that is, eating more vegetables to ensure the reduction of carbon emissions in food. For example, riding more bicycles and traveling less by car are my personal favorite. First, I feel uncomfortable when I ride a car, and I can watch the surrounding scenery when I ride a bicycle. For the body It's also better, so for me, I like cycling very much, and the video mentions site selection to reduce carbon emissions. I don't know much about this, but I think it's feasible because it doesn't take us much time and it's very simple. If it works, I don't know this very well, but I think it can be promoted, and then for me, it can be promoted In the concept of most Chinese people, traveling by car is a good thing in their mind. Most Chinese people mentioned that the first thing they think about when traveling by car is not that carbon emissions will affect the environment, but that it is a good thing. So most Chinese people don't take the way of cycling, but go to more cars, so I think this method is indeed true Should be promoted to let more people know.

I agree that individual actions will be very beneficial, if we all work together.  If we all begin switching biking for cars and eating less meat, we will help slow the rate of climate change by a lot.  What we need to do is change the opinion of the public on using things that cause climate change.  Much of the change needs to come from the bottom, rather than the top.

I really hope that people who watched this video don't lose the motivation to take individual action, even if our individual action is relatively meaningless on the macro level. I agree with Ken that taking individual action is a very important daily reminder of the crisis. In addition, all of us have a lot of potential of creating change beyond just ourselves. Greta Thunberg is a great example, but because not everybody can become her, a smaller example will also work: students hold positions in many organizations that hold power on this campus. For example, RHA is having an energy-reduction competition between all the residence halls on campus. Students likely brought about this idea that influences the several thousand students who live on campus to reduce energy use. That shows that we as ordinary people can make change in our own community that has relatively more impact than just ourselves.

It's true: personal action is the window to greater change. But I am really glad that this video focuses on how political activism is honestly vastly important, and far more effective. Copenhagen would be impossible without its political activists fighting for a livable city; and in so many places in America, it is simply impossible to ride a bike everywhere or not use a car. Heck, in some places you can't even eat vegetarian due to it being a food desert! 
      <br><br>

But what I really think is the most important consequence of videos like this one is that they show that, well... a lot of times, individual climate activists just feel too much guilt. I sure know that I do. Every time I use a car I feel bad about it, and, well, I should to an extent, but sometimes it really is inevitable. Some areas simply do not have bus routes, or train routes, or their buses or trains are vastly inconsistent and unreliable. And we can't-- individually-- do everything about it. There's no ethical consumption under capitalism, and all that. Yes, we need to do individual things, yes we need to eat less meat, yes we need to be avoiding cars as much as possible... but it's understandable if we occasionally do something that's not good for emissions. We can't be perfect, at the very least not yet. And it's good that we can all recognize this.

After watching this lecture video it confirms that the only thing people can do is vote. Sure if a single person makes changes it will help Earth but in a very minuscule way. Glad professor Hitlner stressed the point it only takes an hour a year to vote which helps out the world. That’s pretty cool Ken bikes to and from work everyday. I know Santa Barbara has more bike lane options and better public transportation than LA but as Ken talked about in the video they are still not that safe or viable here. As Ken stresses its the sum of all these actions together that will help our planet not just a single one.

I’m positive that everyone can take an hour of their year to mitigate climate change by voting. It’s literally the least amount of effort you can put in to make a change for our future generations. It’s slightly dissuading that even if we all change to a plant-based diet and change our lightbulbs to LED, it’s still not enough compared to just fracking. Even though beef production and consumption are sources of carbon and methane emissions, we shouldn’t diverge our focus on fighting these fossil fuel interests. Knowing that Ken bikes to work every day makes him a little more persuading than other climate activists that we hear. It’s scary to hear that cyclists die from biking on a regular basis. It makes me less inclined to bike on big roads. I’m lucky to be going to a school like UCSB where bike access is prioritized. I’ve been biking since freshman year and now I’m a senior. It’s the quickest way to get around, not necessarily the safest way though. I’ve gotten in major bike accidents where I had to go to the emergency room so it’s still a safety problem everywhere.

I agree with you that it does discourage me when I found out that switching to a plant-based diet or changing our lightbulbs to an LED one is still not enough to be compared to fracking or animal consumption. When Ken said that in the video, I was thinking “what’s the point of switching my diet if it barely works” but I realized that even any effort to reduce the increase of carbon emission is beneficial to the planet. I currently am a second year and I used to bike around during my first year here. I found out the bike path is super dangerous because people disregard the rules and just bike however they want to. I started to walk more and I think it’s a good change of scenery. I still do bike around but only when there are fewer people so it would be less dangerous. I only got into one bike accident and got hurt in several places. I hope you feel better after your bike accidents!

I totally agree! It’s shocking that one of the biggest ways to change the environment takes the least amount of time and effort to do. Voting is a right and privilege that we Americans are lucky to have and we should actively use our voice to help the planet, and it really is not that hard. Even in lecture, many students registered to vote in less than a couple minutes and now all we have to do is vote for those who are in favor of helping the environment which is such a simple task to do. If we find it difficult to work from bottom-up (making lifestyle changes such as biking, and then calling for bigger changes around us), instead we can do the opposite and start from the top, by voting for politicians that will make transportation more efficient and biking safer, so we can implement these small changes into our lives in an easy and convenient way.
<br><hr>
I hope UCSB will take into consideration about improving bike regulation to ensure safety for its students. Even things like removing old bikes to provide more spaces for people to lock their bikes will increase the likelihood of students biking more. I did notice the new bike path change by the bioengineering building. If it can help diverge traffic during peak hours, then I’m all for it. As students, we should also be courteous to others that bike faster. If you know you’re on a cruiser and you will be travelling slower, then stay on the right side of the lane. For me personally, I hate when bikers have headphones in and decide to do sharp turns last minute. That’s how people get into accidents even if you are well aware of your surroundings. Some stuff you just can’t avoid. I would walk if I have extra time and when it’s not cold out, but most times I find myself in a rush so I resort to biking and just hope for the best.

<br><hr>
Even though voting is a simple task, it’s important to know who you’re voting for. Sometimes these candidates’ platforms are being overlooked. I believe it’s our responsibility to look into their policies and see if our beliefs are aligned with theirs. Perhaps the AI is working harder than these politicians because recently ever since I started taking this course, all the ads that popped up during commercial breaks are the ones that are endorsing candidates who believe in climate change and climate crisis. I think it’s great, but I don’t like how in the end it would say this ad has been paid by certain candidate running for a certain campaign. I feel like they should find another way to spread their policies and not through paid ways.
<br><hr>
I also think that its a bit discouraging that our actions are never going to do enough as simply stopping things like fracking. But in a way, this can be a good thing because people are less likely to give up their comfortable lifestyles than to make bigger cultural and political changes as a whole. I think that starting with the biggest and easiest solutions to fossil fuel emissions would be our smartest path to success. In terms of individual actions, people should do the same. Going back to the reading we did last week, we can start by doing the top 25 actions. It's admirable that Ken bikes to work every day, but as he says it's not that much harder than driving. I think if people start caring about climate change, the government might be more inclined to do the same. This is similar to how a lot of brands have started to advertise that they are more sustainable probably just to sell more stuff and while they might not be doing these things, it's still a step in the right direction. In addition to this, I think its great that a lot of celebrities use their large platforms to talk about climate change because they have such a big influence on our society (for some reason), especially the younger generation.
<br><hr>
as Ken emphasized, voting is the single most important thing you can do to mitigate climate change. The 1970s bicycle climate activists paved the way for a source of inspiration. I think especially our current generation should consider learning more about their local representatives and their ideals. Voting is instrumental, but if we have no idea who we are voting for; then this becomes a problem. During my freshman year at UCSB, I went to a voting ballot located near my dorms. Although I exercised my political voting power,  I made the mistake of voting without information regarding the representatives I was voting for. Thus changing the environment begins with such a simple task like voting, but is also important to get to know your respective representatives.

I believe that it is important to remind everyone that even if their personal actions are making a miniscule impact on reducing climate change, the fact remains that you are still reducing climate change.  If everyone who renounced beef for environmental purposes suddenly decided to begin eating beef again because they think their actions are not contributing to the movement to reduce climate change, our climate crisis becomes even more urgent.  Even though we should know that we need to do more than consuming less animal products and switching to public transportation, it is also important to know that the small lifestyle changes we do make are making some change, though it is small, against climate change.
      <br><br>
I found the example of Copenhagen’s switch to biking as a main source of transportation very interesting.  I believe that this can be very effective if implemented in areas where people’s commute is short, because people would be less willing to switch to a bike if their commute by car is over an hour.  An unfortunate fact is many Americans have never imagined a life without a car.  I have grown up believing that at some point, I will own a car and use it as my main source of transportation.  I have never thought about a future where I do not own a car and use bicycles or public transit as my main source of transportation.  It is important to  change this mindset as I am sure many other people may also think the same way.

My mom used to put a rock in my shoe so that I wouldn’t forget my key anywhere. (I used to lose it a lot) The idea was that everytime I would stand up and start to walk away from wherever I had been sitting, I would step on the rock and say “OW! Why the H*** is there a rock in my shoe!” and then realize that it’s in there because I just left my key on the table. I bring this up because it lines up with what Ken said at the end of his lecture: small, personal things that you might do to reduce your own carbon footprint helps you to keep the topic of climate change at the front of your mind. 
      <br><br>
In keeping climate change at the front of your mind, you enable yourself to be more active in the community of climate change activism. You'd better be able to reference actions other people can take, better be able to select officials for political positions, and be better able to talk from a position of authority, as you’re really about what you’re talking about. Think global, act local.

Nice anecdote, I see how it ties into the overall lesson of this lecture video. Perhaps we as a society need some kind of pointy rock to nudge us into the right mindset. Again, I think that the rock for us consumers would most effectively be a carbon tax as previously discussed. It has the same purpose as the rock in your shoe; every time we would  get taxed for consuming a product with a carbon footprint, it has the potential to alert us, keeping the environmentalist mindset in place. Of course we dont want to be paying extra, and saving our chances of survival sounds pretty worth it overall it has the potential to be a win-win situation.


<br><hr>
I really enjoyed that little anecdote! Like you said, constantly doing my own little things to try to help the environment have really kept the climate crisis in my head more than it ever has been. Every time I go to make a meal I remember that I’m no longer eating red meat (which is a decision I made after watching “Cowspiracy”), which triggers me to then remember WHY I’m no longer eating red meat. Every time I go to take a shower, I remember that I need to try to keep it as short as possible, and I remember WHY I should try to keep it short. It all comes full circle. When people don’t educate themselves on climate change, though, they don’t have the information that causes them to implement these little changes in their daily lives. Most of us in this class know the critical impacts of stuff such as flying, wasting food, meat-heavy diets, and many other things that have such a tight grip on our culture. If I wasn’t forced to educate myself on these topics, though, I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to do so. The only way I can see the rest of our country/world to implement their own little habit changes is if politicians either force everyone to educate themselves or just flatout force everyone to change their ways; I can’t foresee this happening anytime soon, considering many politicians aren’t ready to do either of these things themselves.

Although personal effort is far from enough, it is still very important. But we need do it in another way. The first thing is about culture. In many places, owning a car is a kind of fashion and the prove of your social status and wealth. So thanks for the advertisement and brainwashing of car industry, buying a car is becoming a target that people are fighting for. The utility of the car is considered less important than the byproduct of owing a car, such as sense of mental satisfaction. In other word, car is no longer a transportation tool; it’s a symbol of who you are. In this case, how can we connive the public to get rid of car in a large scale? What we should do is developing public transportation culture. Making it into a fashion that people want to pursue can guide people actively use more public transportation. For example, in 2016, Blizzard entertainment cooperated with the railway system in my city to advertise their new game. They decorated the whole carriage with poster, which had attracted many fans, including me, to take transportation. Another thing is offering necessary infrastructure, like safe bike lane. It’s just like selling product. When you provide your consumer with a new kind of product, they might want to try it.

The question Ken brings up "Personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active. Which matters more?" is I think an almost redundant question to ask inherently. Because they all matter the same amount and they all would not be effective without the other one. We can not be climate activists without becoming politically active, we can not preach and ask governments to bring about change and ask society to change without changing ourselves and we definitely should not expect that just by changing our lifestyle (one person out of one billion) that that is essentially enough to change the outcome of the world. I understand however that that might seem almost disheartening because I personally have gone through that. I question why I would change my lifestyle if no one else is? How much difference I can make? And yes I agree with those statements to an extent because I believe that eating a climate-conscious diet and biking around is simply not enough to bring about the desired change. But as Gandhi said, and Ken reiterated, be the change you want to see in the world. We need to do more, no matter how much you're doing, you need to do more. 
      <br><br>

One thing that amazed me was the progress made in Copenhagen, Denmark. I feel like every day I find out about another European country that's doing something better than the US. Yes, they have higher taxes, but they have so many benefits that Americans only dream about: Good retirement plans. free or very cheap education, amazing maternity leave, great infrastructure, good health care for all, and now they're beating the US by a long shot when it comes to action against climate change. I mean every single year a city that is 0.0208% the size of California, not the US but California, causes a reduction of 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 emissions a year, because 62% of their population travels by bike. So I did calculations and if 62% of Californians started commuting by bike then we would reduce carbon emissions by an outstanding 249.515 BILLION metric tons of CO2 emissions a year!!!

So you just gonna be an activist being active taking personal action for activism taking action to be politically active? Kidding...but on a more serious note, Ken, can you post a video tutorial on how to convert your ordinary bike into an e-bike? That would be so cool, especially solar-powered. And I’m sure it would help a lot of people opt out of taking their cars outside of campus and ride their bikes instead.
      <br><br>

It seemed like your class has been entirely focused on taking individual action to mitigate climate change this whole time, from changing our diets and forgoing cars. But it makes sense that focusing on individual consumer behavior is not adequate. So, I thought it was more about individual action and that if we all did our part it would solve the problem. However, the reality is that the fossil fuels we use for energy and transportation have a more significant impact than our meat consumption. Because most people will not likely voluntarily stop eating meat, the largest methane problem is hydraulic fracturing. In the U.S., fracked gas and oil are used to produce energy, and we are fracking HALF of the oil we use. Although the argument can be made to shift focus away from individual action and become activists that work to ban fracking instead, I believe a combination of these is the best solution. Copenhagen’s cultural change as a reaction to the 1970s energy crisis really shows the importance of voting in local elections and climate activists. Let’s vote for candidates that put the people over corporate interests so we can mitigate climate change.

This is exactly like allyship. If we want a revolution, we NEED the people. We need numbers, we need every body on this planet! The people need to rise up! We have to always actively tell people what is happening and engage in conversations that will change behaviors. We need to talk about the injustice, the inequality. If we can eliminate injustice, then we can eliminate all issues. As I am pretty bias and would love for this world to be a certain way hah, it is clear the diversity of opinions is a big contributor to the beauty of such a creative world.

I did have concerns about my personal choices and if they would really help. While I knew that what little effect they may have, they could still help. It is scary to think that while switching to a plant-based diet is highly beneficial for the planet, it still won’t be enough because how dependent the world is on fossil fuels for transportation. While voting is not enough, I have learned that voting is sooooo important. Being able to vote and having a voice is such a privilege and so important. It lets politicians and people in charge know what people want to see and what people will support. When Ken said “I have never once encountered a traffic jam on my bike path” I laughed because while I haven’t encountered one I have seen it happen on campus. As a matter of fact I got a bike after arriving to UCSB because I realized I would probably need one to get around instead of walking or taking the bus every day. During the first week of my first quarter I realized how much people are in the bike paths when I have to go to class, so I didn’t ride my bike to school and I still have not. I very rarely ride my bike as I usually take the bus. I realize that I should though to help the planet.

I like how Ken began the video with the solutions everyone believes will save the planet. Like taking fast showers, switching out light bulbs. Like most of society I have fallen for these ideas as solutions. But from taking this class I have quickly learned that they will only pay a small role in my impact. That the huge companies came up with these as solutions so that they would not suffer. But I found it interesting that meat consumption can hide the biggest issue of fossil fuel consumption. Although it has an impact our dependence on oil is responsible for ⅔ of emissions. That even if the whole world ate vegan, we would not solve the crisis. The issue with the crisis is society cannot choose one thing or another inorder to fix the mistakes of the past. We need to make a complete cultural transition to have hope of saving the planet. 
      <br><br>

Methane, everyone knows a huge amount is emitted by cows. This is spread throughout many sources, but society must realize that even more comes from fracking. Fracking creates sources of oil that is used in every step of production and products of everyday use. There is no way to avoid it as mentioned by Ken. This is why I agree we need to rely on renewable energy. We need to vote, and take action. If a person does not want to spend their days eating plant based food, they can take an hour out of their year to go vote.

I think it is a poor mindset to see personal action as ‘not enough’ and insignificant in its impact on the world. 
      <br><br>
I agree with Ken that the reality is, there is no way that everyone on this planet will decide to stop consuming meat for the sake of the environment and the climate crisis. However I don’t think we should belittle the power of influence. The personal changes we make should be seen as more than changes we make for the betterment of ourselves and how it makes us feel in regards to ‘saving the planet,’ but it should be seen as a way to spread awareness and attempt to change social norms and beliefs that fuel many of our unsustainable practices and lifestyles.
      <br><br>
 
As Ken mentions, we cannot stop practices like fracking firsthand through personal actions. For this reason I believe that we need to recognize and take action upon what we can do. We live in a time and place in which we are able to vote for change and regardless of how insignificant one’s vote may seem, your vote plays a role in the contribution for change. There is power in influence and power in numbers.
      <br><br>
It is important to focus on what is realistic. And that reality is that we should be focusing on what we can advocate the average person to do in order to combat the rising temperatures and the greenhouse gas emissions. Personal action is where it all starts.

You make some really valid points in regards to personal action on a local and global level. Ken mentions that indivdual behavior won't do it, but collective action will. If one person stops eating meat the environmental impact will be very insignificant but if an entire city stops consuming beef the impact is much much greater. So yes I agree that we need to get rid of that ‘indivdual action is not enough’ midset because collective action will not and cannot take place when us as individuals are thinking in this manner. Personal action is definetly where it all starts.

Fraking is the bigger methane problem because our modern lives are fuled by gas and oil. In order to topping fraking we need to bring the issue to politicians. Politicians have the power to pass legislations that can bring an end to fraking. The power of voting is sometimes taken for granted but as indivduals this is the greatest influence we have towards our government and society. We need to start voting on behalf of our planet, this means on all elections whether it be local or federal. We need candidates who are not about corportate interests but about the people. This is not an unrelistic goal as you mentioned, this approach in many ways is more effective and plausible in comparison to everyone going vegan or getting rid of their vehicles and switching to other forms of transportation.

It is unfortunate that I find myself taking my car to school more often than not. I get lazy when it rains, when I haven’t slept or am feeling under the weather. This is a habit that I recognize is breakable. After watching the lecture, I feel compelled to keep the car in the lot and my butt on the bike! I regret having a car that uses premium gas and guzzles it down quickly. I claim to be pro-environment but my actions don’t always line up with my political preferences. I look to vote for a candidate willing to step up and take action to protect our water and air but on a personal scale, I have a harder time letting go of my conveniences. This is a sentiment I know most American kids share. I believe that taking political action is so important and I need to extend my practice of looking for a way to help into my day to day. I have already begun to reduce my carbon footprint through the use of my bike that I bought early in the semester. I value my future over my inadequate sleeping habits! And I can continue to put this into practice in the dining hall, on my way to class and when I need to get some groceries. Carpooling, using my bike more frequently if not every day and eating clean are all ways I am attempting to better myself in this regard. This is how I am taking personal action on a smaller scale. On a larger scale, activism for representatives I believe in is the most important thing I can do.

In order to fully secure this clean and responsible transition to clean energy and produce zero emissions, I believe the roles of all these forms of activism is vital to the overall benefit of our country and the global environment as it requires all aspects. One can not be politically active and effective through it without personal conviction and action as a motivation for it, which is represented by the saying “Talk the talk, Walk the walk.” While they are all in correlation with each other, I believe the results of political activism are most important in order to secure the legislation and support from politicians needed in order to transform our society with the policies that will keep us checked in place through the transformation of our economy to be fueled by clean energy.
      <br><br>

As Ken mentioned, simply eating a plant-based diet isn’t enough unless changes are made to our entire economy and this will definitely have an impact on all social and cultural factors; however, we need to view this as an essential component in combating climate change, but this doesn’t mean we should dismiss the health or stabilities of the American people, which is why the security aspect of the Green New Deal is important to be established in order to create a basis of security for citizens if they are to support this plan in the first place.
      <br><br>

While we may have a different population size, culture, and other factors from Copenhagen, this doesn’t mean we can’t undergo the same transition as they have done through the adjustment of infrastructure and encouragement of public transit or transportation by bicycle. With travel through cars being such a large component of our lives in which it has been completely normalized by society and culture, and admittingly necessary for many people, I also wonder how America would undergo such a change and would love to hear Ken’s suggestions for this matter as it would be affect many people’s commute, affect businesses, and more. In addition, I wonder if America would be able to give up control over oil reserves and how that would affect our economy and even other countries as a result.

Learning that no matter what we do, changing to a plant-based diet or changing the light bulb to a more eco-friendly one, still doesn’t reduce the carbon emission to the level we want somewhat discourages me. I thought as long as a good amount of people do it, it will reduce a significant amount but after hearing what Ken said, it doesn’t do as much good as electing a candidate that will help pass laws to reduce carbon emission. Voting for someone who also fights for the same cause for the planet will be beneficial since they know the effects of rising carbon emission in the atmosphere and if everyone takes the time to understand how the rise of carbon emission affects every living thing on the planet, they will definitely vote for someone who will do something about the rise of carbon emission.

After learning about Copenhagen’s bike structure, it makes me think about UCSB’s bike path and how efficient it is for people to get around since there is a designated bike path but I think the bike path is super dangerous because a lot of people ignore the bike path rules which causes accidents. People should learn the rules because I have seen countless bike accidents where people were in the wrong but argue that it was the other person’s fault. I personally think the bike path is scary because people are all in a hurry to get to their classes and will disregard someone else. Though the bike path is very eco-friendly, I think UCSB has to fix its bike path so there are fewer bumps and potholes and wider since there are a lot of bikers.

I feel like that is why it's so hard at this day and age to combat the climate crisis because it's easier for people to watch advertisements on their T.V about cool and new things rather than getting an education on this subject. Just because switching to a plant based diet and changing appliances to eco-friendlier ones do not have that much of an impact on the amount of emissions being released into the environment does not mean people should stop. The little things matter too because it all adds up together. If businesses see that more people are switching over to sustainable practices then they will eventually advertise for that and then politicians would follow to get more support. Also, commenting on your statement about people ignoring the bike path rules: I'd rather get into a bike accident than a car crash because there's a higher probability that I get out of there with my life and just a few scars. It is true that the bike path is scary, my friend has crashed multiple times because she's clumsy and other people just don't know when to yield, luckily I have not crashed yet and I'm hoping I don't. I agree with you that UCSB has to fix the bike paths though because a lot of the yield signs are faded and the pot holes really don't help either. I also think UCSB should lower the amount of parking spaces for students because there is no need for them to drive their car to class. It's also cheaper to buy a bike than refilling your car with gas and if they want to say it's to drive home then they can just take the train or the bus. I personally think becoming politically active matters the most when trying to get your ideas across people's minds.

I agree with a lot of what you had to say regarding this lecture. It is essential that people make lifestyle changes to mitigate the climate crisis, but in the grand scheme of things, I don’t feel that this will make enough of an impact with the current mindset of our society. It is entirely necessary that politicians are elected who will advocate for climate justice on a large scale. Beyond just enacting legislation that will reduce carbon emissions, I think that the political tactics which have been used to incite doubt about the crisis can be shifted to work in the favor of climate action. In the same way that the media has framed the crisis to be a matter of political strategy, the narrative can be changed to shift the view of the public towards the actual specifics of the problem, the best solutions to tackle it, and the political candidates who will carry them out.

It's interesting to hear that Ken rides a hybrid electric bicycle to commute from downtown SB to campus, but at the same time, it's not unexpected at all. Ever since I got my own bike for the first time in Santa Barbara, I have been using it to travel and commute around campus and the Goleta / Santa Barbara area with no issues at all. Since we have some sort of a bike lane on almost every street here, I feel much safer than if I was biking everywhere back home in LA. Biking on the road in LA in the same lane as cars is so dangerous, and I am too scared to even try. I do not have my driver's license yet, and the mobility that I have without one in Santa Barbara right now is convincing me that I don't really need a car, at least for now. When you bike, you don't have to pay for parking, pay for gas, pay for insurance-- it's perfect for my current living situation. It's pretty cool to see the vast number of students who ride bikes as their main mode of transportation here in UCSB, and I really appreciate the bike paths that we have here even if it can get a little crazy sometimes. I really resonate with the bicycle activism that Ken talks about, and hopefully more and more cities will follow Copenhagen's footsteps and make biking a safe and desirable way to travel.

I agree with you. After watching this lecture video, I feel the charm of Santa Barbara as a huge biking community more. By biking from downtown to school as Ken does or between classes and IV like most UCSB students do, we are saving millions of CO2 released into the atmosphere. It was surprised to realize how one small city could save 3.8 billion tons of CO2 by simply switching over to bikes. Biking not only could shorten our traffic time but also could help us get a daily healthy workout. If we could make a car-free law and begin switching all the transportation in a community to bikes as done in Copenhagen, the United States’ carbon footprint would be greatly reduced. What’s more, I think one of the biggest obstacle to develop a community like this is that the bike infrastructure isn’t good enough. If we could spend more money on building safe and good bike lanes, people would definitely be encouraged to join this movement and bike more.

From this week's reading and videos, it is evident that everyone, especially our generation, must be politically active. This is the only way to make the extreme change we need in regard to combating climate change. Since every other country is actively trying to change their day to day lives to save the planet, America, being the largest CO2 producer and consumerist culture on the planet, must follow. When laws are implemented to make more efficient public transportation, stop fracking, as well as limiting the agriculture production, we will not only transform as a nation but also in our local communities. In light of the upcoming election, I am hopeful that this change will come sooner than we had all expected.

I agree with you that our generation and specifically the individuals hoping to see change need to become more politically active and need to vote. Even if someone cant commit to activism people could still be politically active by voting. I believe that activism is the only way to ensure real change. As Ken has pointed out before “knowledge is not power unless acted on”. I think this is true for the climate crisis. I do think that spreading knowledge through activism is a great way to spread a message. Many Americans are unaware about the current state of our planet. By informing others about the issue through activism allows those that are newly interested in the issue to get involved. As more people come in the support the more likely the local or national government will listen. As Ken pointed out in the lecture video, Copenhagen was able to create change in a local level by activism. Now Copenhagen is leading by example. I agree that it’s unfortunate that even though the US is the leader in CO2 emissions yet we can’t withstand the mild discomfort of making change. Many of the older people in my family would never take a bike to work. However, as Copenhagen has pointed out riding your bike actually become something that they looked forward to. This was a huge cultural change and as more people supported the more likely people began to switch because it was what everyone was doing. 
      <br><br>

      I think what this comes down to is priorities. Here in the US many are not willing to shift their priorities for the greater good. Our individualistic society has caused us to become rather selfish, to the point where our planet is on the verge of its 6th extinction. I am also hopeful that with the upcoming election we can see more people come and support leaders that are working to benefit everyone and not just big businesses. 
      <br><br>
 In response to Kens question, I agree that they are all connected. I think its beneficial to start small on a local level because its seems like a much less daunting task to accomplish when it is just on the community/ local level. Once activism can be used to leverage change on a local level then communities of like minded individuals can come together in support of greater change for the population as a whole. Considering the US has been a world leading economic power sense the 1871 we would have a huge impact on the rest of the world if we could make changes like Copenhagen. For those of us here in the US this means we need to come together and support activism and support by voting.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that political activism is the key to real change in America. Even as some of our generation begins to make the necessary lifestyle changes towards a sustainable future, Ken's lecture and videos from this week make clear that personal action is simply not enough. While individual action is important in spreading a environmental conscious throughout the public, it does not create substantial change to the industries that are responsible for much of our environmental impact. For example, say everyone in ENGL 23 stopped eating beef and dairy products. Although all of us would be reducing our overall carbon footprint, the beef and dairy industry would continue chugging along like nothing had ever happened. Governmental policies and laws are what can make significant changes to these harmful industries, but we need to act so that our government is a reflection of our desires. What it really comes down to is voter turn out. If you want to make help cultivate change, then support those politicians who listen and echo your sentiments best. While I, like you, am hopeful change will come sooner than later with the upcoming election, I am  discouraged by our electoral college system for presidential elections. I am from Boston, MA in what is almost always a blue state, and sometimes I feel as though my vote will count towards nothing because I know which way my state will side regardless of if I vote. Despite this discouragement, I feel like I really have a voice in local elections and primaries which I find to be the most important and best place to start actively fighting for change. For change to happen it has to first be on a communal scale from where it can build and grow from, and it is on that scale where I encourage others to really speak up and make their voice as well as there vote be heard and matter.
<br><hr>
I agree that the only way to see substantial change is to take political action. The personal changes that we choose to take have a limit to how far it can change and fix this problem. Several people can choose to reduce their carbon footprint and become vegan but to see the substantial change we must become politically active. The article and videos have given us a plan on what to do but a plan with no action is useless just like Ken mentioned. The action that we must take is not just in our everyday lives but we must push and make our government listen. The US has a huge influence on the rest of the world if we become politically active on ideas like the Green New Deal that will fight against the climate crisis. Will make it more likely that others will follow and create a ripple effect that will have a substantial change against climate change.


<br><hr>
Unsurprisingly, I completely agree with Raul. To care is to vote, and when you vote is when you take matters into your hands. The voting system was put into place for situations like this when popular movement can create and has to create a difference that will be felt across the globe. As the leaders of the modern world, the United States has the responsibility to show the rest of the world which way we should move forward, especially in a topic as sensitive as climate change. No longer can there be any denial of climate change and it should not be a question of what we should do but rather how we can start said operation as quickly as possible. The freedom to vote is one that is often overlooked and especially underutilized especially by those in my age group, this can no longer continue. In due time, my generation will be in power and if we don't understand that today, I wonder if we will get the chance to see the day where current college students are the leaders of this nation.

I really like this video because it focuses on personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active as significant ways to help combat the climate crisis. Professor Hiltner does a great job of introducing these things and having the class contemplate the importance of all these things because if everybody did all these things or a combination of these it could push our country forward in the direction of greatly combatting the climate crisis. Professor Hiltner gives great examples of personal action, climate activism, and even some political activism. I absolutely love his example of biking and voting as examples of personal action and political activism that are some of the simplest things that individuals can do if you want to do some big changes to help the climate crisis.

      <br><br>

Voting is such a simple act that many legal citizens in the USA take for granted. I believe that personal action, climate activism, and political activism are all equally important and people should be doing a combination of two out of the three actions as a significant way to grassroots up to help fight the climate crisis and to show local, states and federal governments that this is an issue that the American people care about. As citizens, we should vote for politicians who feel similarly to how we feel about climate issues like making better bike lanes and areas and giving people incentives to use public transportation or biking than using cars.

Professor Hiltner, in my opinion as well, did a great job of explaining why personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active are a power combo in the fight to mitigate climate change. Even though doing just one of these things can make a difference, it truly is the three actions combined that will get us through our climate issues the fastest and most efficiently. I also agree that voting is such a simple act and that many people have taken it for granted. To be fair, I was one of those people last year when I first was eligible to vote. Looking back I feel terrible that I didn't take advantage of my right to vote now, but also I wasn't very educated in politics mainly due to the fact that my parents were always telling me to stay out of politics. It's very frustrating now to look back at my childhood and see how much I was discouraged from speaking about politics in my household because it was considered "un-ladylike." Screw being ladylike, I want to fight for what's right, and the easiest way is for me to become politically active. I can understand why many people take for granted the voting system, because from my perspective my family always said that our voices in the voting system don't matter, they'll just do what they want anyway. I also was told that there's no point in voting for the candidate you want if they aren't likely to win, and I feel like that is such a cynical way to put things. I'm grateful for my education as it has opened my eyes to the reality of being politically active, and the importance of personal action and climate activism. I feel that education is key overall in fighting the climate crisis. The proof lies within myself even, just getting an education has made a huge change in me, and I feel like if more people had access to the education I've gotten, maybe we could make more progress in our fight.

I found it very interesting what Ken said about how dangerous biking actually is. I have never thought about that before. I kind of thought that people just didn’t want to bike because they were lazy, but now that I think about it and think about how biking works on state street, it is in fact very dangerous. It makes sense why people would rather drive their car than ride their bike, especially if you have to use your bike at night, on a unprotected shoulder, traveling with cars going 50 mph or faster next to you. I feel like if we were to fix this issue, more people would want to bike rather than driving, decreasing one’s personal carbon footprint.

I also never thought about the danger aspect of biking; it makes sense that the potential dangers that you mentioned are an area of concern for people. I always just assumed that people would be unlikely to bike because it was slower and required more work, which I’m sure also contributes to people's unwillingness to stop using cars. I was surprised by how effective the changes in biking infrastructure was in Copenhagen, and it gives me hope for other countries as well.

I agree with the idea that although individual action by reducing our own carbon footprint is a good change, it is not nearly enough for the problem at hand. As Ken explains even if the whole world went vegan it would not be anywhere near enough, major changes such as removing the usage of all fossil fuels is a very drastic, but needed change. Yeah I think for people to even consider foregoing gas and oil they need another form of energy they could use, otherwise getting rid of fracking is unlikely to happen anytime soon. I agree that a step in helping the planet that could be taken now is people voting for candidates who prioritize the people and the planet ahead of corporate interests. I think the idea of making bikes a main source of transportation is a great idea and with added safer infrastructure to bike lanes it would prove successful if the public could get behind the idea. Yet it still leaves the problem of very long distance travel not being possible with just bikes in mind. I do think Copenhagen gives a very good example of a successful implementation of using bikes as a primary mode of transportation yet, I do think it will be harder to get people behind the idea here in the United States. Since people value the freedom of being able to drive anywhere they want and biking would restrict that to a degree.

I enjoyed learning about bicycle climate activism in this week’s lecture, specifically Copenhagen's bike culture. It is crazy to know that 62% of the people in Copenhagen commute to work or school by bike. It is more surprising to me that this big development is a recent cultural change. It proves we have the capacity to change our way of life for the sake of the planet. It now solely depends on whether we are actually willing to execute the actions needed. I am grateful that I live in a community here in Santa Barbara where biking and busing to places is normal.  This is especially not the case in my hometown, Sacramento, or at least, it is definitely more inconvenient. However, I am striving to make the effort to implement biking and busing into my life when I go back home after learning more about the condition of our planet. 
      <br><br>

In addition, I find it mind-blowing that one or two hours of voting per year can change the course of this planet regarding the climate crisis. However, it saddens me that a good portion of eligible Americans do not vote despite the relatively little effort that it takes. One vote may be the difference for a change to save our planet.

I am also surprised by the fact that 62% of people in Copenhagen bike to school or work. That is something drastically different from what American lives are like. We really could mitigate the climate crisis by changing our lifestyles-- primarily changing our ways of commuting. Though speaking of which, it would seem impossible for the majority of Americans to shift to biking from driving. However, it would be so much easier to just vote for people who advocate for policies for our climate. Unfortunately, I am an international student and not eligible to vote. But if I can vote, I will definitely vote for Sanders!

I support all of those who participate in meaningful and positive climate activism, and I do think that the work they do is necessary to promote and spread the idea that we need to change the way we treat the environment, and that we don’t need to wait to start doing it. We can do it right now. However, I would hope that we eventually get to a point where activism is even necessary; that we can all have a common mindset, and know what we need to do and when we need to do it, and act on it immediately. I do find it disheartening that we even need people out protesting to raise awareness about climate change, as it should be clear and obvious to everyone that we are wreaking havoc on our environment with our consumption, and that if we don’t do something about it now, then we are in serious trouble. I do agree with Ken and many others that one of the most important methods to implementing change and action is through voting. And not just voting for anybody. We need to really take a look at our candidates, who they are as people, what their values and beliefs are, if their actions actually follow those values to make sure they aren’t just talk. We need to spend more time researching those we elect into office to ensure that they are honest, caring, and forthright people that genuinely care about others, not just their own self-interests and money. Just watching commercials or occasionally watching clips of debates or speeches is not enough to know if a particular person is best suited to be in a position of power. So often do we just willingly give these positions to people who do not deserve them. We need to make sure they do. We need to hold them accountable for their words and actions. We should and need to expect so much more from the people that run our country, and make being a politician a prestigious position only given to those who care about helping everyone, and serving everyone’s best interest.

I believe that a synthesis of climate activism and political action will occur once folks start to take personal responsibilities for their impacts to the climate crisis. I don’t think that either of those two things, which both require great organization and further work, would be possible if people weren’t first trying to change their own lifestyles for the bettering of the planet. 

      <br><br>

That being said, personal action is not the sole proprietor of changes to environmental policy. In order to surpass simply changing what occurs in our day-to-day lives, which won’t be enough on it’s own to save the earth, one must examine the systematic ways in which we have continuously poisoned our planet. As I mentioned in a previous post, all this action is well and good, but nothing will come of it as long as we have massive bureaucracy in the way. 

      <br><br>

As such, I don’t think it’s a question of what’s more important between personal choice, becoming a climate activist or becoming involved politically, but more so about how each of those dimensions can be applied on a case by case basis.

This video highlights the complicated      <br><br>

nature of fighting the climate crisis, as well as the frustration us individuals
may feel as we try to figure out our place in it. Do we go vegan? Do we stop
driving our cars? Do we start making all of our clothing by hand? Do we drop
out of school and quit our jobs to become full-time activists? There are so
many possible ways to make a positive impact, it is impossible to pick the “right”
course of action. This can seem like an overwhelming burden—I know I’ve felt
this way for a long time. But this can also be seen in a positive light. The
solution is not rooted in us as individuals; it is rooted in us as a
collective. So, rather than isolating ourselves into our own self-serving,
eco-friendly behavioral changes, we must mobilize, organize, and realized our
collective ability to change the system. Social change occurs when enough people
rally together to fight for the unified goals that they believe in. Rather than
feeling good about our individual carbon footprints, we must take collection
action to penetrate the political sphere and demand action.
      <br><br>




Ken states that the most important thing
we can do is vote. Although I agree that voting is important, I think there are
more important things we can do. Voting is a crucial feature of our participatory
democracy, but the system is flawed. Most people don’t even understand what the
hell they’re voting for. Voting is also a corrupted process, that is honestly
more symbolic than legitimate. At the end of the day, it’s hard to tell if your
vote won’t get rigged in some way. Even if there is nothing illegitimate about
our electoral process, voting still fits neatly in the framework of our
bipartisan political system, which in itself is a total shitshow. Our partisanship
has produced nothing but polarized ideological battles that result in impasse
and hostile antagonism. In my opinion, the most important thing we can do is
talk to each other. To communicate effectively. To attempt to understand what
we really think about climate change and our society. To understand our values
and beliefs. To level with each other about the measures we can actually take
to change our system. To form strong relationships and expand our social
networks to build a cohesive unit of collective action from the ground up. Voting
may be arbitrary, but a gathering of real physical human bodies protesting and standing
up for a cause is tactile and unignorable.

I agree with your commentary on our "democracy" at the moment. I will vote, and I have been since I could, but I have always been aware of how partisan issue/ideologies are more powerful than the well-being of the voter who is choosing these issues, and on top of that, there are too many corrupt powerful people in our government that would not allow the things we vote for to truly happen. It is almost naive of the public to not see that the voting process is rigged, the American government is truly evil and they will do everything in their power to keep things to their benefit. I want to have faith in our system but I don't. Like saying this I sound like a Libertarian or something but it just stems from my frustration with the interventions that have been in our elections. Personally, I feel as if action has to start by targeting companies and those emitting the fossil fuels, yes the government allows them to have certain policies and under the table deals that benefit them in the end, but we are the ones consuming their products and allowing them to exist in the first place. If we can eliminate their power and influence at some level, then we can have more of a leverage on the government as they will be less likely to be swayed to rig elections or modify legislation bc of corporate interest.

As this course continues throughout the weeks, I began feeling rather small compared to machine like forces of the fossil fuel and beef industries. Living in America, I come to realize more and more each day how strong of a grip large companies have in shaping the society we live in and the way things are consumed. Consequently, it just made me feel like there was not enough benefits environmentally for me to completely change my lifestyle habits, although I completely believe everyone should live with a sense of sustainability in mind. Although it might be bad to admit, I do enjoy eating a burger once in a while and I do like traveling by car with my friends to new destinations. Even after knowing about the environmental implications of these things I don't think it's ignorant of me to enjoy them once in a while because the fact is, the majority of Americans are going to do it regardless, at least I'm trying to cut back a little bit. Ultimately, the point I'm trying to make is that personal action and sustainable habits are important, but not nearly as important as voting for people to try and restructure America away from fossil fuel reliance. It was stated that 2/3 of America's carbon emissions come from the fossil fuel industry and that fracking provides half our oil and 2/3 of our gas. In my opinion, finding alternatives to or limiting practices such as fracking has a way greater urgency and impact to our climate than having a select few of the population refrain from eating beef.

I completely agree. Last year I took and ES class and it made me realize how little of an impact we as individuals have when it comes to making impactful change on the issue of the climate. Sure eating less burgers and buying less clothes can make a minuscule difference, but it is not worth the hassle in most cases - in my opinion. I still believe that a change needs to be made and it must be soon, but I think the only practical and realistic method in which it can happen is through government/policy.

      <br><br>

Although the current political climate is a bit of a mess, government is still the best chance we have of not all going extinct. Theoretically governments could place higher taxes on companies for their use of fossil fuels as well as help fund renewable energy initiatives. While this sounds nice, it is not that easy due to party conflict and general differences of beliefs. While not easy, it still is the best chance we have. It is unfortunate we have to leave these things up to people in politics, many of whom are bigots and mostly just dumb. If people could make a bigger impact on their own, I would like to think the problem would be in better hands. It is so important for everyone who is able to vote so that we can see real selfless leaders in power who understand climate change and its implications rather than power hungry idiots who do not know what is going on.

I have been an electric bike rider for more than a year back in China. I used to ride my e-bike to my high school which is about 5 miles away from my home every day and it took me 15 minutes to get there. The reason why I chose to ride an electric bike instead of taking a taxi or driving is that I do not have to worry about traffic jams at all. Usually the traffic in China around 5 pm. is a nightmare for cars, and sometimes you have to wait for several minutes to drive a single block, which truly is a great method to spend time with your favorite car. However, riding electric bikes has a shortage. During summer and winter, you really should be brave to sit and ride an electric bike. The seating cushion in summer would become hot enough to cook a raw egg if you do not offer it some protection. During winter, the freezing wind would make your whole body freeze and make you sick. However, I really recommend California to have more electric bikes since it's definitely the best way to travel a short distance.

In this lecture, it informs how voting is very important to get rid of fracking but also brings the attention of the politicians to the public. This is important to improve the weather conditions and make a positive impact to the economy since we are removing fracking. With the reduction of fracking, this would lead to less health problems like leukemia and cancer and less gas emissions.In addition, activism is also important because being involved politically and making a stand can help engage others and inform other people. This will inform others to make a difference and help improve climate change.Alos, voting is very important because it will determine and distinguish who is better fit and help improve climate change. With more people being involved politically, this will allow for more regulations and regulations to help improve our conditions.Ken also emphasize how bikes are much more environmentally friendly than cars. The United States used more gas than a lot of the countries, and it is kind of devastating since we try to be united. I feel like we need to make a change and try to reduce our gas and fracking.

It's absolutely astounding to me that Copenhagen theoretically reduced emissions by billions of tons by biking instead of driving to school and work, but let's not forget that Copenhagen isn't Los Angeles. That's not to say it couldn't happen here in Southern CA, but that is to say that it's as much a cultural change as an infrastructure one. Yeah, bike paths are great, but the real key to getting people to bike to work is to change our perception of cars. I've been biking all my life, I learned very young how to ride, and I've been doing triathlons on cheap little bikes ever since. If there were real bike infrastructure set up that could avoid rush hour on the 405, I promise more people would bike to work, but not nearly as many people as would bike to work if Kylie Jenner posted about how important it is to bike in LA.

Individual changes and personal actions themselves will have little effect on the overall state of the climate crisis when done individually, but when done in mass, they will obviously have exponential effects. Voting is the single most important thing we can do right now, in addition to personal climate activism that not everyone has time for. It becomes a matter of principle too. It is not only about the positive changes that people like AOC can do, but it's about voting out deniers. We need to make the houses of congress unsafe for those who accept money from big oil and let fracking occur without consequences.

I am also from Southern California and agree that biking instead of driving would not be an easy change for LA. It is heavily influenced and ruined on cars as the main transportation. Also the bike lanes do not seem safe at all. There are not many to begin with and there are times in which bicyclists are forced to endanger their lives by riding them. I often fear to hit one while driving as there is no safe lane for them. Which made me not want to bike, due to the fear of my safety. Like Ken said, if bike lanes were improved there would be more people biking.

Also I knew of the importance of voting before but taking this class has really enforced the importance of it in me.

I agree with your comment about how it is truly amazing to see how once a smart greener system is implemented, emissions drop. While we have to take into account that larger populations will require more work in reducing the cumulative CO2 emissions, there is already progress in certain smaller countries. This ambitious standpoint for transportation is necessary, as we can see places such as Copenhagen and Japan now rely on public transportation systems. As they took away resources from roads and put them towards transportation systems, they ultimately reduced the carbon footprint from mass amounts of cars on the roads. They have successfully transitioned to fewer cars which is something we are all capable of doing whether on an individual or societal level. While I am not from LA, I am from the Bay Area, and transportation is very much an issue there as well. On the average day, what would be a fifteen minute drive now becomes two hours or more in bumper to bumper traffic. There are no bike paths that connect to major cities making it nearly impossible to transition to a greener alternative. While biking is next to none, I have started to witness more public transportation options and uses which is reassuring at least. It all starts somewhere.

It’s very hard to have any sort of faith or hope that we are going to resolve or even get through the climate crisis. I think it’s accurate to say that most people aren’t going to voluntarily make personal changes to their diets or really anything. I feel like I’m a lot more environmentally conscious than most people and I can’t even get myself to go fully vegetarian yet. I still eat chicken and consume dairy in most of my meals. How could I expect people who barely know anything about the effects of their personal actions to change if I know what I’m doing and I can’t even do the right thing? I guess I’m still doing better than most since I take the bus and train most of the time and I don’t consume red meat. But what about flying? I’m definitely not going to be the type of person who travels somewhere just because I know it’s going to disappear because of the climate crisis but if it just so happened that my parents planned a trip where we needed to fly, I probably wouldn’t refuse. It’s hard to stop doing things you know other people get to enjoy. Is it better to sacrifice to make the difference or act blind to be able to enjoy what little time we have left? That’s another problem I have with the situation, I could make the sacrifices but in the end the problem might not be fixed. As I am writing I think I am answering my own questions because I would most likely tell someone with this thought that no one is ever going to change without other people leading the way. Through writing this comment I can see that we need all the people we can get to lead by example in order to combat the climate crisis, at least that’s the positive way of thinking about it. In a bigger sense, our country needs to lead by example.

I also feel that it’s very hard for people to voluntarily make changes. For me, a student taking this environmental-related course, I feel absolutely guilty that right at this time, I still can’t give up taking the flights or switching my diet to a plant-based one. As such, I truly don’t think just by educating people on the importance of doing one, two and three will actually resulting in them voluntarily change their personal preference or cultural tradition to realistically do one, two and three. It is almost the basis of human nature that without external force, we are very likely to remain in our current comfortable position and reject any change. As a result, here comes the role of political action. I believe that a public, universal and uniform resolution being enforced by either the government or the law is the most feasible choice that will actually get us to our destination of mitigating climate change. Without such multilateral enforcement, it is just so easy for everyone to stick to their promising yet empty words instead of making the change. Personal action should obviously be encouraged but in a realistic world, I am afraid it wouldn’t achieve an adequate result, just like Profesor Hiltner said.

As cliche as it sounds, personal action, climate activism, as well as becoming politically active are all essential for saving the environment. One thing however is that it seems to always start with personal action that will gradually lead on to making bigger change through the other categories. Some statistics that I found interesting how there is such a big emphasis on diet but even if the whole US turned vegan it still would not be enough. After learning so much about the methane produced from the beef industry alone I was astonished to really think about how much of our lives contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases. Copenhagen is an inspiring example of how a new culture can be developed for the benefit of the world and I think the US has the ability to take that even further and show how we can make positive change on a much bigger scale. Just in LA if we have the potential to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by billions of tons through somewhat reasonable means. This however will take time because I also do not feel secure biking in the street because of the common mentality that even if it is not your fault you can die from how bike lanes are set up now. That is the important connection between linking politicians who support bikers with climate change and just shows how much needs to be done to eliminate our carbon emission but also goes to show how very possible it is.

One of the biggest takeaways I got from learning about the green new deal is learning how it could affect working/lower class people. Even though half of the GND are promises to make sure this doesn't happen, it’s hard to see how they can execute it effectively. I believe the GND is necessary but I believe they should find a way to ease the transition for all the people out of jobs. I don’t think going from where we are now to 0 emissions just isn’t plausible. It is just too radical of a shift that just holds too high of a risk for the people on the bottom. From the lecture video, I believe making the bike transition will be a major win for climate activism. But the only way for this to happen especially in the US, it must be affordable. It needs high incentive and a low price. If the infrastructure is put in place and if electric bikes become easily affordable then I believe most people will just transition to bikes for trips under 15 miles. Even though cars will still be in use, their use will be cut down significantly (on the local level).

I agree with you when you say that there needs to be a way to ease this transition to help prevent people being out a job. If not, we would be making it worse for us in the long run. How can we possibly try to convince so many people to be on board for a new deal such as the Green New Deal if there is always a horrifying thought going through their heads of losing their jobs over the deal? We need to be more careful and realize that these are realistic thoughts; however, these thoughts do not need to turn into outcomes. We have to do a better job to ensure people of a bright future in all aspects of life. Show them that not only saving the earth will help them, but it will immensely help their kids, grandchildren, and so forth. This Green New Deal is surely worth fighting for and we mustn't give up!

I wanted to comment upon two things that Ken mentions in this lecture.  First, he mentions that people are likely to be as hesitant as they are to changing to a plant based diet to change their ways of getting electricity.  I have to disagree with Ken here.  People would be more willing because for them the way in which they use and receive energy wouldn’t be drastically changing.  It's less of a personal change, and more removed from their personal lives.  People have more of a problem with making drastic and personal changes.   The thing that I do agree with in this circumstance is that it is far too expensive to make your house "green."  If it was more affordable,  I definitely feel as though many more people would already have or be on their way towards having green energy within their own homes.  

      <br><br>

I also wanted to comment upon the bike issue that Ken discusses here as far as safety.   Advocating for bike safety is an important part of making a change in the climate crisis.  We saw the effect that it had in Copenhagen and Columbia. As a result of the right political actions, they have a much safer and more active biking community.  I know that I for one, especially when I was younger was afraid to bike through my city at home.  I lived in a relatively busy-street kind of area, and would constantly be afraid to ride two feet away from a 3 ton car going 4 times my speed.  Even now,  biking on campus could definitely be improved upon.  There should be more space, routes that are more accessible to the different halls, etc.   The very first day i rode my bike this year I was hit from behind, because there was not enough space to be able to bike around slow-goers.  You may call this freshman luck, but I know countless people on campus who have gotten into accidents with other bikers, and some even with cars.  If we implemented something like what we saw in the video Ken showed in class, I think we would have a lot more people biking often, which would definitely decrease our ghg emissions.

I also found the part where Ken discussed bike safety very interesting and I believe that bike safety must be improved on in order to encourage people to use them for commuting. Here on UCSB campus, bike safety and accessibility could definitely be improved upon, however, seeing as the only other option is walking, I do not think that people being discouraged to bike to class is necessarily that bad. But yes, encouraging more people to bike could be beneficial in the way that it would allow them to bike to various places off campus instead of taking an Uber or other form of vehicle transportation. I feel like many cities in the US have trouble with the creation of effective bike lanes because of our infrastructure. In order for safe bike lanes to be put in, a great deal of construction is often required to remodel old, narrow roads. I grew up in the Bay Area and I remember the extensive construction that would happen for months just to create a very narrow bike lane in one street. I think that many cities and towns probably feel discouraged to implement bike lanes because of the inefficiency. This is why it is important for us to encourage lawmakers to put more money towards infrastructure and the remaking of roads to include safe bike lanes.


<br><hr>
I agree that the alternative to on campus biking is also clearly not harming the environment (with the small exception of those who do drive on campus)  But, I do think that having better bike conditions on campus would persuade those who don't own or use bikes to do so, which would likely carry over into their off-campus outings as well.  I agree with you, I forgot about the issues with road construction, as that's something that affected myself at home as well, down south.  We do very much so need to vote for politicians who will work towards sustainable transportation options.

I have seen before that a particular criticism of the climate movement from those that are hesitant to join it is that their individual contributions do not matter because companies contribute much more emissions than the people as a whole, or that there are so many people already taking charge that they would not influence anything. Yet, a statistic from UCSB’s American Presidency Project itself shows that generally only around half of the voting age population actually take part in elections. That is a staggering number of people that let their voice be wasted because “they don’t matter.” I imagine that if everyone who thought like this did decide to use their voice and vote, things could possibly turn out much different. Every little contribution helps, whether it be individual or as a collective.

Changing individual consumer behavior feels in many ways … worthless. My difference is minute, while the corporations causing the most damage remain unchanged. I am surprised to learn that everyone on the planet going vegan isn’t nearly enough. I was under the impression that if everyone on the planet went vegan we would be reducing our greenhouse gas emission nearly enough. I wonder what the impact on our economy, either beneficial or negative, would be with a switch to green energy. I worry that if our economy suffers a tumultuous period during the switch, we would not be able to implement green policy. In fact, it is something I worry about the 2020 presidency.  What Trump is doing to our economy is good in the short term perhaps, but it is disastrous for our long term economic health. If that all comes to front under a Blue 2020 presidency, I see the country going hard right. I wonder how much of a difference our world would have seen if Al Gore had won Florida. The number Ken quoted, 3.8 Billion pounds of CO2 reduction, is kind of insane. I like the quote Ken brought up, “we become, indeed embody, the change we want to see in the world.” Personal actions beget change on friends and family, and it spreads outward from there.

Sometimes, it's disheartening to realize that your own efforts to adhere to a greener lifestyle does not amount to much in the grand scheme of things. I can see how it's easy to think that big personal changes like adopting a vegan diet should, in theory, benefit the planet by reducing methane emissions from livestock that other people consume on a regular basis, but as Ken realistically notes, this won't be enough, and most people are not keen to change their ways, especially in a highly personal area of their lives like food. Despite this grim outlook with regards to personal action, I still think that personal change puts the climate crisis into perspective and leads to an overall healthier, affordable lifestyle, making some of the actions highlighted by Ken quite appealing. I too worry that should another recession akin to the Great Recession occur, climate policy will become the last thing on everyone's minds once again, and may even become a target of criticism and scapegoating, setting our country even further back in terms of progressive, tangible change. Because of this, voting has become more important than ever, much more important than personal action and activism in my opinion. If a democratic administration replaced the Trump administration, we could see revivals of Obama-era environmental policy that the Trump administration so eagerly axed in addition to fresh legislation to start working towards a more sustainable future, possibly altering the current "American dream" that motivates so many. As Ken advised, electing officials that support broad environmental legislation like carbon taxing at both the local and federal levels will lead to greater progress when it comes to combating climate change than personal actions ever will.

One key issue that I would really like to be addressed is bike infrastructure. I feel like here in the U.S. it is really dangerous to get around on a bike because of the way bike lanes are set up. The bike lanes are right next to car lanes where cars are going at 45 mph -- so if you get hit, chances are you are not going to be okay even if you're wearing the mandatory safety helmet. It scared me to hear that four cyclists have been killed in Modoc and news like this only serves to deter people from commuting on bikes. This lecture video reminded me of the lecture a few weeks back where we watched a video on bike lanes in Copenhagen, Denmark. Those bike lanes over there were in between parked cars and the sidewalk, which makes way more sense to me because than cyclists are protected from direct hits if an accident were to occur. These lanes would also promote bike transportation in general and help reduce our carbon footprint on the planet. A reduction of 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 emissions per year for one city sounds very good to me.

I also agree with you that the US needs to focus on building better infrastructure for bikes. Even at UCSB, which is a place that is considered to be bike friendly, I have been a part of and witnessed several gruesome bike accidents due to traffic. I believe it should be a major priority for every large city to build walkable and bikeable downtowns so that people can safely go to and from work on their bikes without the fear of getting hit by a car or another biker due to congested lanes. In addition to the bike lanes, cities should strive to improve subway and bus systems to encourage more public transportation. If the quality of the bussing system improves it can become the norm. For example, I know that my dad who works in the silicon valley now prefers to take the bus to work because of the free wifi and comfortable setting that allows him to get a head start on his work. In my opinion, improving transportation systems seems like some of the most convenient solutions to the climate crisis and much more desirable than becoming a vegetarian.

After watching Ken’s lecture, it has become clear to me that if we want change to happen, we will need to implement legislation. The majority of people, not just in the US but around the world, will not change their lifestyles voluntarily. This is clearly where the Green New Deal comes in. The Green New Deal would, “[eliminate] pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible” and would, “...dramatically [expand] and [upgrade] renewable power sources.” This would be very beneficial for our environment. However, because of the current political climate, the passing of the Green New Deal is not feasible. Because of this, like Ken said, the single most important thing that you can do it to vote.
<br><br>
Another thing that I found interesting was Ken’s use of the pedelec bike. Even though I am a student in decent shape, it is still hard for me to bike long distances. When I first came to UCSB, I bought a bike and to this day, I am still shocked at people who bike for fun and/or choose to bike instead of alternative means of transportation, despite my bike being an efficient means of transportation at UCSB. It is just so tiring. The pedelec bike, which is a hybrid bike that’s powered by an electric motor and pedaling, is so beneficial. This bike has a range of 25 miles and a top speed of 25 miles per hour, biking to work or to other locations seems a lot more realistic. This way, you don’t have to be in crazy good shape in order to get places so more of the population will bike. Again, though, we need to vote in order for this to be safe. Like Ken said, the local, state, and national elections all play major roles in mitigating the climate crisis. Bikers should not have to commute next to cars traveling at 50 mph and risk their lives.

I'm also intrigued by Ken's use of the pedelec bike. A lot of the times, people do not really want to bike because it's just so tiring and driving is convenient. I think it's a great way to get around while reducing your carbon emissions. We really need to make the roads safer for people to be motivated to not drive. Where I'm from in Los Angeles, I see a good amount of people, including kids heading to school, businessmen in suits, and just people having fun, riding Lime or Bird electric scooters and electric bikes called "Wheels." It's cool to see that more people are using these transportation alternatives, and we need more regulations to keep everyone safe.

I have come to the same realization that implementation of legislation is critical. When a policy is passed, there are still many times they aren’t followed, but without them, they are even more unrecognized in importance. While there is the viewpoint that most people will not change their lifestyles voluntarily (as I see it this way as well), there have been previous readings, lectures, and films in this class that have suggested otherwise in pushing that many people would be happy to make changes once they realized the benefits. I think this is the struggle: how to make them realize the benefits and how to allow them to properly weigh out the pros and cons short term versus long term. At the end of your response, you bring up the importance of the role of elections and voting, and the older I get, the more I hear this and feel this, and I truly believe every voice matters, and wasting a vote is not necessary. An interesting point you make is about your stance on biking. Prior to coming to UCSB, I had not biked for 7 years already, not having had needed to or wanted to (fear of falling). After I moved off campus during my sophomore year, I was forced to choose to bike, walk, or take the bus. At first, I hated biking, all the dangers and falling, but now, despite still getting into accidents once in awhile, I have come to see the ease in it and its many benefits environmentally, health wise, and time saving. I get where you are coming from, but for our campus, our biking pathways are so developed and vast, we are truly a progressive school for bikers. I am incredibly proud of that, and hope that there will be fixes to biking infrastructure such as the roads to better support bikers. In a previous reading or lecture, I remember this being covered, how if the government and facilities aren’t on board, then the funds don’t get to go to these sorts of things, which is why voting and politics is just as important as our activism efforts and passion, because we need the funds to make action happen in certain areas.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your comment. I think you made a great point about our political climate today and how it is making the installation of the Green New Deal sound impossible. It is unfortunate to see that the climate crisis has become a political issue. It was made clear in all of the films and lecture videos this week, that climate activists are struggling to get their point across because of the bias and tactical framing in our media today. It is also clear that because of the political climate, just as you mentioned, voting is the most important thing we can do to help. 
<br><br>
I found it very interesting that Ken admitted that personal action, what he has been focusing on so far in this course, doesn't really address the bigger issue of our increasing amount of GHG emissions. Sure, switching to a plant based diet, consuming less meat, and utilizing public transportation are all personal actions that will reduce your personal carbon footprint. But, it is not enough to really make a difference in the long run and on the bigger scale. Ken even says that even if everyone on the planet went vegan it still wouldn't be enough. This makes it sound like there is no hope, but in fact, voting seems to be our last chance to fix the climate crisis. I especially liked how Ken said that you don't have to be a famous actor to be a climate activist. I think there is an underlying belief that the ordinary person can't make a difference and that it is the reason why climate activists don't seem to be taken as seriously as they should. I admit that before diving into this course, I was skeptical about how I personally could combat the climate crisis. Now, I am fully aware of my carbon footprint and couldn't agree more that voting is the easiest and quickest way to be an activist. I plan to vote in this upcoming election and am hopeful that my generation can take a big step towards climate centered legislation and an environmentally focused government.

I enjoy this video since it reveals the effects of our personal or political actions. Ken states that although everyone on the planet changes their diet to vegetarians and alters their light bulb to a more eco-friendly one, it will not reduce many CO2 emissions as we expect. It is actually discouraging, but I still believe that as we continue and persist to do these, it will somewhat help the environment or at least save energy and resources. Moreover, Ken claims that one important thing is to be activists or climate activists. To become this, the most effective way is voting. Like in Copenhagen, politicians encourage and force governments to improve their infrastructures to create better conditions for cyclists. In this case, 62% of people in Copenhagen ride bikes to work and commute. It is a progressive effort and action and gives us hope to be active in voting to urge politicians to do some actions that are friendly to our environment. Generally, personal efforts in both daily life and political area are necessary to take actions in helping mitigate or reduce climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We should continue to do this or even do more.

This lecture video Ken states that personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active, becoming politically active can matter more. Actually, even though people change their meal diet into vegan and decrease the beef consumption and install solar panel, all of these actions cannot solve out the basic problem of global warming and climate crisis. The main reason of climate crisis is fossil fuel fracking. However, politically active advertisement and propaganda are able to help to alleviate this situation. I like the example of voting in the Copenhagen. Citizens vote to have more privileges for riding. So, citizens go work and go school by cycling. I think the government need to pay attention to the environmental problem and use the power of politics to lead more people to protect the environment.

When thinking about Climate Change, we often think a lot about technology and personal things to do. I think by now, it's not only important to take personal action but also take action against the leaders that are in charge of making the big calls. We need to revert our attention to the main source of a lot of these issues, our government. Right now we have a leader who doesn't believe in Climate Change. I think the upcoming election is a major decision on wether or not we will be able to take action against climate change. We can protest, strike, and much more for this cause but at the end of the day, the government is in control. We need to step up and vote for someone that will take this issue serious.

I agree with you that just like Ken mentions for the current situation personal actions are not enough to save our planet. And that we need to vote and become politically active and to bring the issue of the climate crisis to the attention of politicians in the public. Ken also noted that one of the important things we can do to make changes is to ride bikes to school instead of driving, this is not that applicable to me because for now, the bike infrastructure seems unsafe to me, but I will try to reduce the times of driving cars and take public transportations instead.

In this video, Ken has mentioned the climate activist Michael Mann. According to Mann, he think that the problem is not on our personal choices (being a vegan or consuming beef, etc.); instead, the problem is the civilizations reliance on fossil fuels as it constitute ⅔ of global greenhouse gas. At first, I was shocked when Ken said Mann was right and claimed that simply changing our lifestyle will not meet the goal to lower the world's temperature. I was quite disappointed when I heard Ken agreeing with Mann. I have always thought that if each of us contribute a little to reduce waste and greenhouse gases emissions, there will be a huge difference. However, I am glad that Ken has emphasized that personal action, climate activism as well as being political activie are all important and are interrelated. It’s not that personal choices are not important. On the contrary, it’s that we should think beyond switching to a bicycle or other environmentally friendly choices.

I agree with you that I thought Kens acceptance of Mann's opinion wasn't expected when I feel like this whole quarter we have been taught that its about doing anything, even if its small. Even though personally we cannot put an end to fracking and lower the global greenhouse gases, we still have the power of being a citizen that has an affect on our future. Like Ken talks about, through personal action, climate activism, and political activism there is hope and these kinds of personal choices are important. Since Ken talks briefly about voting for candidates locally and federally who will support changes of policy and other things like the Green New Deal it would be interesting for him to share with us the political candidates that he stands behind. I am someone who hasn't done a lot of research on the candidates, and frankly I am not sure I would know the specifics to look for under what they are advocating for so it would be pretty cool if he could share some of his insight with us. By the end of the day even if every single person were to do one of these things the results would show. You don't have to become a vegetarian, but you could at least vote during the elections. You don't have to stop driving your car, but you can consider eating primarily vegan meals. There are so many small options for people to adjust their footprint in society, and I really do believe that every change matters.

Referring to the title of Ken's video, I think that all three are related to each other. Being a politically active person means being able to believe in a cause (which is a personal action). It takes all three to really solve the climate crisis. The individual, the group, and government must all come together to solve these problems. It's a very difficult task to balance the three. But while all three are necessary in the fight for climate activism, it is political change that gets the most results. Legislation will have a big impact because it will make polluting companies comply with new environmental laws.

Despite knowing how effective the improved bicycle infrastructure turned out in Copenhagen, where 62% now commute to work or school by bike, I unfortunately still have doubts that this would work in America. The infatuation with consumerism and the culture of cars that exists in America is unparalleled in other nations. Therefore, people will continue to purchase cars for the style aspect, even if it’s not necessary to actually use for transportation. Personally, I know my own dad is obsessed with cars and wants to have all different types of them, even if it is an impractical car that he won’t be able to drive the car everyday. I’m sure there are others who feel the same way, and with the advancement in cars such as self-driving Teslas, it will be even more difficult to wean people off them. Still, I want to remain hopeful for the future of our nation, and maybe with the combination of personal action, climate activists, and political activity, we will be able to take steps to mitigate the climate crisis.

I do agree that the materialistic culture and consumerism will make it difficult for people to give up cars for bikes. Since social media promotes trying to have the latest or popular car. I think a big part of it is also that people are not doing to want to change their lifestyles because it would be an inconvenience they do not want to deal with. Also I don’t think influences of celebrities who have expensive cars will take a lead in giving up cars and promoting bikes as being a trend, so people will not be inclined to try to make that change, at least not in the way things are right now.
<br><hr>
I agree that a shift away from cars is less likely to be seen in the America. In recent years, my hometown Long Beach has made strides to create a more bike friendly city and was even named in the top 10 most bike-friendly cities in America. Even though I saw changes such as more bike lanes being added as well as putting barriers on some streets to offer more protection between the bike lanes and traffic, I did not notice any changes to the way we commute. There wasn't a noticeable difference in the number of people commuting via bike that I could see and there were no changes in the amounts of traffic. Even with the amenities to promote a more bike centric culture, there was not a significant shift among the residents of the city. There has to be more of an incentive or personal motivation if we want to see a real shift in our lifestyles.

I found it interesting that a place such as Copenhagen which gets colder than most places in the United States has still found a way to put a huge percentage of their population on bikes. I also liked how Ken stated that just one city doing this could save 3.8 billion tons of CO2 from entering the Earth’s atmosphere. And that if bigger cities such as New York, LA, Chicago, etc could do something similar we could be looking at a much larger difference in our carbon footprint. 
<br><br>
I also liked how Ken mentioned that the biggest thing we could do as individuals is vote for politicians and policies that will help ensure us the best chance in our fight against climate change. I think another important point he raises is that we need to do this on a local level too. We tend to forget that locally we have more sway in how our community helps out in this global issue. Our votes and our actions need to start in our community and we each have a responsibility to ourselves, others, and the planet to do the best we can on a day by day basis.

I am impressed by the  responses to the energy crisis by Copenhagen such as car free Sundays. To me, that sounds unattainable here in the U.S., but it is important how Ken communicated that they met serious issues with serious solutions. This is an important model for moving forward as we will have to shift our perception of what is reasonable to match the severity and urgency of the issue we are trying to resolve which is climate change. The beginning of this lecture highlights the importance of understanding the big picture. It makes total sense that we would focus on the things we feel we have the most control over and that we have a hard time trusting the value of our personal vote. It is easy to get sucked into one aspect of the climate crisis or to focus on just one solution. This is also understandable because the issue is so complex so focusing on one thing is easier than grasping all the contributing factors and potential solutions. I also like Ken's reminder of the importance of voting and it is especially relevant right now and for our age group. I agree that we forget about our local power and often we don't even know about our local politics but really we could see more immediate change if we were more involved with local politics. This goal of working toward bike infrastructure is direct and the positive effects would be huge so this seems to be a great local issue to focus on.


<br><hr>
When thinking about the change to bikes it had never occurred to me about how much colder it could be. We can adapt in different ways to that easily, thankfully. I can totally see mass bicycling becoming a thing in the future. And if bigger cities like the ones you mentioned had a majority of people traveling my bikes the impact would be huge! Of course that alone won't save the planet, but this type of degrowth would be amazing. And if people needed to travel farther faster without public transportation they could get a type of motorized bike that can go up to 28 mph. That's still way better for the environment than driving a car. And this issue has to deal with all three of the things Ken talked about. We need personal action to get people to switch to riding bikes. We need climate activists to make the public and politicians aware about wanting to lower our carbon footprint by switching to bikes and thus needing different road ways to adjust to the needs. And we need to be politically active to vote in favor of it and for people who also support it. 
<br><br>

Our vote is incredibly important, even on a local level. You’re right, we do tend to forget that locally we have more sway in how our community helps out in this global issue. Think globally and act locally! We have to start from the bottom, our roots, in order to make change. And voting is a very fast and effective way to do so. But what’s also important is telling other people to vote and why it’s important, and thus being a climate activist in a way too. So many people don’t vote because they don’t care and or think their vote doesn’t matter. But that’s incredibly false, so we must support people and educate them on this! We need a balance of all three of these things in order to make change, so we must collaborate.

I find a number of problems with the suggestions that Ken makes to live a sustainable lifestyle. First, the idea of biking everywhere is considerable to those who live in big cities where most grocery stores, hospitals, and malls are in close proximity. But for many of those who choose to live in rural (which will soon increase because housing is more affordable in those places) biking 12-14 miles to work isn't really a viable option. I live in the Santa Catalina dorms and just the mile to get to campus is a huge deterrent when I have to get up for an 8am class. Second, a change in lifestyle is hopeful at best. The unanimity that comes with agreeing to reforming the American lifestyle is near impossible. The idea may take off as a phase and stay relevant with the youth but there are so many other factors that create pressure on the layperson to conform to the lifestyle already in place. The most common example is buying healthy groceries from whole foods to buying dinner at McDonalds. Economically, a legitimately sustainable lifestyle is, for now, exclusively accessible and affordable to a small fraction of the American people. I believe that change can only truly be achieved in this country through exercising the right to vote. To elect people in power who have climate change as their first agenda.

I understand the position you are taking completely. Our circumstances are dictated by socio-economic distinctions that we have to live through and adapt. Yes, a transition to a biospherism lifestyle is a priority if we want to meet the temperature limit that we are not on track to hit. However, our living circumtances divert our priorities to what's more important in our situation. The effects of climate change are delayed and indirect so we don't really really recognized the urgency of the transition that we have to make. I applaud you for recognizing that generating a movement led by the government is key to solving this issue as a whole. I'm definitely pessimistic about meeting our goals by 2050 with the pace were going in. Our government shutdown just because of partisan arguments, imagine them tackling the green new deal which are composed of really partisan environmental, social, and economic issues. The sentiments that our governments are prioritizing are far from the direction that we are panicking about. I don't think it's possible for our government this transition. It is our job to use our power over the government, but this issue needs to be normalized in our daily interactions before that happens.

To simply answer Ken’s question, becoming politically active is more generally important than making those changes; however, both are extremely important to the efforts of mitigating our carbon footprint. Ken mentions that these little changes that we make to our lives can actually inspire others to follow and if one becomes politically active and speaks out on those ideas, they can become a basis for what the future could bring.
<br><br>
After watching the lecture video, I also understood that changing our public transportation systems and the way we move around is possible. It would help centralize communities while also reducing their carbon footprint and eliminating the possibility of hazardous events. In the same light, people must understand that local and national transportation practices impact the climate crisis, which means that voting is vital and those who don’t vote for what they believe in and want, should reconsider their focus, and become more involved. The severity of the problem has become too large in the U.S., and as Ken has reiterated many times, we must change the little things, our habits, and the consumer culture that dominates our country and it’s happiness.

I agree with you that being politically active may be more important than the other two. But at the same time, personal actions and climate activism are also very important parts in the society. We definitely need all three parts in order to truly make a difference in our world. Being politically active can push more regulation on carbon emissions and restrict pollution by big companies. Personal actions done by every single one of us can make a huge impact on climate change. And the climate activism can let people know more information and raise awareness to more people.

It is pretty upsetting to find out that all the things Ken has been encouraging us to do are very minimal in the grants scheme of things. I though that if everyone went  vegan, reduced my food waste, switched to public transportation, and bought less stuff we would be able to fix this problem. Turns out, that is not NEARLY enough. Even if we lowered our emissions in our everyday decisions, but flew the same amount, we would still be on the road to major devastation environmentally, economically, culturally, and socially. Ken also mentions that we still heavily rely on fracking. I was shocked that although we have known about the side effects that come with relying on fossil fuels since 1973, we still get 2/3 of our gas from fracking. When we have all the technology in the world it is crazy that we have not been using exploiting these better resources. People are so resistant to the change when photovoltaics, geothermal power, and wind power are much better in the long run. We must make these energy changes now and not hesitate. We must vote these changes into existence so that the people with power are more prone to carrying out these changes. I agree with Ken that if we could do just one thing to better the environment, we should not become vegan, we should just cast our ballot consciously. Meaning we should not just go into elections blindly, but research the candidates and vote for the ones who will actively try to resolve climate change.

I had a similar reaction to this video as Lauren. I was frustrated and disappointed at Ken's point that making personal changes- even if they are sweeping and drastic in our personal lives- will have very little effect in the long run. I was genuinely excited for the challenge of becoming vegetarian and then vegan, becoming more minimalistic, getting solar panels when I own a home some day, and changing my transportation means. Although I will still do as Ken suggests in terms of voting, I feel discouraged by the rather (un)likelihood that our government will ever actually stand up to large fossil fuel industries. I don't understand why people are so afraid of change. I don't understand why the fossil fuel companies won't convert to clean energy and just maintain their only goal to make buckets of money. I don't understand why our government has to be so polarized that it blinds us to the issues right before our eyes. I guess I very simply just don't understand our people. We've known about all this for DECADES, what makes anyone think that it's going to change now?

<p>
The biggest problem I've always experienced, both personally and with people around me, is the harsh reality that individual change truly often does not make that much of an impact. You can try to do everything you can to mitigate climate change, and mitigate your personally carbon footprint, but the sheer number of people in the world who do very little or almost nothing to mitigate their footprints will always end up overpowering your individual actions. Personal action also becomes much more difficult when it comes to living in poorer areas compared to wealthier areas. Many of the people I know here come from considerably high-income areas, whereas my hometown has lots of very poor areas. Those that I know from wealthier areas are extremely aware of more "environmentally-friendly" options for daily life, and I feel guilty seeing how much more they seem to do compared to me, but being environmentally-friendly is not a heavily pushed ideal in my hometown. Even with the reality that we would be drastically affected by climate change because of how much my county relies on agriculture to stabilize and support the local economy, very rarely are any actions taken or encouraged to help climate change. 
<br><br>

This is why I think it's more effective, (but certainly not all that each of us should be doing), if we exercise our right to vote so that officials who recognize the human impact on climate change can be elected and help ensure that climate-conscious policies get passed. If we don't vote, that's a big fat f**k you to the planet, in my opinion. You don't have to become an activist on the level of someone like Greta Thunberg, but you should make it clear to your elected officials that you expect to see them supporting policies to help climate change; if they don't, it's imperative that you push support towards candidates who do support climate change action over the incumbent who doesn't.

Ken’s lecture puts climate crisis action into perspective in a way that allows me to see activism in a bigger picture. I feel like I’m personally more comfortable taking personal action in ways that are “simple”, but when it comes to speaking out and letting others know about the climate crisis, I fall short. I just had a conversation with a family member who was saying she didn’t want to vote this year and for some reason, I didn’t want to say anything about it in fear of creating tension. Realizing that voting is profound sparks a sense of empowerment in society and is a chance to let our voices be accounted for. 
<br><br>


Before attending UCSB, I never rode a bike to commute anywhere because in the Bay Area I don’t think it’s that accessible, safe, or practical. Driving between cities is definitely normal, therefore, a lot of traffic is created. If safe and prominent bike lanes became established, it could get many cars off the road. I’m glad that while I’m here I drive my car much less and mostly rely on biking and taking the bus. 
<br><br>


Now knowing that if everyone became vegan it still wouldn’t be enough to mitigate climate change, it feels a little bit discouraging, but I don’t think it’s reasonable to omit trying at all. I still want to make small changes where I can and become more aware of the politics surrounding climate change.

I enjoyed this video a lot because it showed me that activism does have positive outcomes and is super effective. I visit Copenhagen every year over the summer because its one of my favorite cities. Copenhagen is super progressive and that completely translates to the way the go about looking out for their environment. After the energy crisis in 1973, activists in Copenhagen pushed to create more bike lines and create a more bike-friendly environment. Today, the bike infrastructure in Copenhagen has only grown. I learned that 62% of people their commute to work or school by bike. This is over half the population. When I think about the bike lanes in California, I am shocked by how dangerous they are. Often times, a thin painted line separates bikes from roads with cars traveling 50 miles per hour. If cities could plan out better bike lanes, I think more people would ditch cars and start to bike.
<br><br>

However, to get cities to do this, people need to vote. Ken explains the large impact voting has on the climate. Even voting on a local level can impact politicians on a federal level. It's all about starting a chain reaction of activism and working to reduce the amount of emissions used every year. I learned the 3.8 billion tons of gasses are not released every year due to Copenhagen's successful bike system. When I think about the size of a city like Los Angeles, I begin to realize how much of an impact it would make if people switched from cars to bikes. Especially going to UCSB, it's very refreshing to see the popularity of bikes and walking. I hope students here can practice activism and find safer ways to grow bike systems in California, and across the US.

You're totally right. We need everyone to start voting and convincing others to vote with them. We need to treat climate activism, social justice and political awareness like a virus -- it is crucial to the future of following generations. It will not work globally at first, we need to start change at a local level and move up the political food chain if we are going to accomplish anything. 
<br><br>

Copenhagen is a great example of this issue. They made a change that was seemingly impossible or even something that nobody saw as a plausible solution! Now they're reducing their carbon footprint by 3.8 Billion tons of C02 every year! They are evidence that a change like this can occur, we just need to start small and implement change whenever we have the opportunity to. This will only occur if we start voting and publicizing our political agendas with the people in power and our community. This needs to be treated like a virus that cannot be quarantined.

Throughout this entire week of reading the Green New Deal then watching dome clips explaining it, and then having listened to this lecture along with the democractic presidential nomination race heating up I have found that political activism is of much more importance than I had originally thought. The government has so much power concerning the issue it is unbelievable, yes there are many things that we can do to help fix the problem, but let's be real. There are a lot of people who either don't believe in climate change or don't see it as an emergency. Therefore, by voting in the right people to lead our government we have a much better chance of saving our planet. Legislation is to me the best way to get around our problem of greed and arrogance. Not only that, but this is a very time sensitive issue that needs our government to act now. I think that laws that control corporations and industry such as fossil fuels, the beef industry, and the fashion industry are the fastest and most effective ways of saving the planet because I personally think that action won't come until it's too late.

I agree politics is really where we must change in order to create real action. Once people have strong leadership that gives them all the information, people will only be able to believe the truth of anthropogenic climate change. We must recognize it as an emergency and do so soon before it is too late. I wish we had better politicians however, as everyone seems to be swayed for their own self-aggrandizement or by lobbying. Change must happen and soon, by electing the right people in place. Hopefully this next time we may have a president who believes in climate change and wants to seek solutions to work against it.


<br><hr>
I agree with your entire comment completely.  I feel very lucky to have a professor who cares as much as Ken does, and urges us to make the biggest difference we can make: vote.  I think it is important to remember, like he says, to vote even when it seems unimportant, because that can make the biggest difference.  Elections on the small scale, like our mayor or governor, and voting for bills, can make a huge difference on the state of our local cities and how environmentally sound they are.  Like Ken said about Copenhagen, they decided to make a change for themselves to better the lives of their people, they rallied for it, and eventually made a difference that affected the world as well in terms of 38 billion tons of carbon dioxide. This is hard to even fathom, that such a small area in comparison to the USA made so much of a difference in the span of our entire Earth.  Imagine, now, that those small steps in many cities around the world took place.  It would become a staircase that leads straight to a better quality of life for us as well as a cleaner environment for all.  As the USA begins to instill some of those ideas like the Green New Deal, we can become one of the leading role models to other large countries to switch to a greener way of life.
<br><hr>
Agreed. It really takes a group of dedicated voters to make big changes in the United States. The election of Donald Trump is a great example of issues firing up a base that went out and actively voted for him. 
<br><br>


The biggest challenge is getting enough people to see how serious climate change is. Ken's video where he showed how different age groups prioritized different issues really highlighted how differently people feel about the issue. Its scary to me that baby boomers don't even see climate change as an issue in the 10 issues facing the United States. I think these classes and the movies on Netflix will ultimately be the catalyst in getting enough people to place this issue at the top of their priorities. I say this because I am still amazed about how misinformed I was on the subject. You can't commit to a cause you know nothing about. How is it that I, a 21 year old 4th year college student, am just hearing about the extent of the damage that will come from climate change? The truth is because I'm too lazy to go out and seek those articles are videos myself. We've gotten so used to receiving all our important information without us looking. The Netflix platform should really try to promote these movies from ethical stand point.
<br><hr>
I agree with with your comment as I also think voting is very important. I think it's a privilege that many people wish they had and those that are able to vote should not take this privilege for granted. Like you mentioned the government has so much power and the fact that most of the people who hold these positions of power are over the age of 55 (boomers) and in denial about the climate crisis is an issue. Although we should vote to try and get better representatives, this might take some time so we should also take action by trying to shift from the luxurious lifestyles we live now to being minimalistic, whether that be by attempting this new lifestyle or just making small changes. You mentioned that there are a lot of people who don't believe in climate change or don't see it as an emergency, I think this is a huge issue. Not only are these climate change deniers voting other climate change deniers into their positions of power, they are also teaching their children to think this too which then creates a new generation of deniers. Educating these people about the facts and convincing them that scientific data and papers are more credible than bias news reports is a good way to instill change.

After watching the lecture video of the issue regarding which type of environmental protection action matters more, I think I have some kind of new thoughts on this problem. All these three were introduced in the previous lectures or film before. Before watching this lecture video, I have already thought about all these things before. In these course, we introduced many different ways to deal with the climate crisis. In my mind, the problems is not which one is better, but which one is more practical than the others. I think, for me, personal actions can be the most practical one to do. 
<br><br>

 Nowadays, we are just student in the college, being climate activist or have some kind of really political influence is not that practical for us, especially for us international students who cannot even vote. I think, for us, learning as many things as we can is the most important, so that we can have some influence in the social later on. Thus, at the same time of studying, doing some personal act is practical, like fly less, change to a more plant base diet, or take shorter showers. These things can not only change the environment, but also remind us daily that we need to do something to change the situation p, which can also be really important

I think you bring up a really good point as an international student studying at UCSB. I believe that we are responsible to do the most that we can to make an impact to prevent climate change. Even if you cannot vote, Ken has provided other ways to make a difference. As Ken says in his lecture, personal contributions, climate activism, and voting are interconnected. Even if you cannot do one specific action, by contributing in the others, you are still going to make an impact. For example, even if an individual cannot vote, climate activism will still make an impact because you do not have to be a citizen. By being a climate activist, you are influencing others to adopt and help advance the personal contributions you are already making. Ken does a great job of illustrating this by using the bike as a personal contribution that leads to climate change and voting. The most important thing I think is to work together to fight climate change. Obviously, fighting this alone is not going to be effective and can be a very daunting task. Activism may seem inconvenient or ineffective, but if we can all find people that also want to make a difference, we will be able to turn out knowledge into power. I agree with you that as college students, however, the easiest way we can make some kind of impact is to adjust our diet and our mode of transportation. This class gears us the knowledge and power to make a difference in the future. However, the future must be in the near future. As mentioned in previous weeks, we cannot delay our actions after we have received this knowledge. Delaying will lead to irreversible harm and even thinking that “we can have some social influence” in the future can be a dangerous mindset. Overall, I think it is admirable and really cool that, even as an international student, you are aware and thinking about how you can make an impact!

After reading your comment, I personally had to reflect on my own life and which tactic was more practical for me. I feel like changing our own personal decisions can be the easiest or the hardest. I lack the ability to change drastically if it influences the conveniences in my life. I strive to be the best that I can be but we are all human. There will be times where I really need to go home and I will use a car rather than a train. Personally, since I can vote, I believe that voting is the easiest way for me. As Ken mentioned, voting only takes 1 to 2 hours of an individual's time and can make an impact on a national and state level. This year will be the first year I am able to vote on issues and I will definitely take advantage of that. Therefore, the reason why I found your comment particularly insightful was because it made me think about my own personal life and which one of these tactics that Ken has mentioned is the most “practical” for me. This also allows me to view myself in a different perspective to restructure and always be aware of my actions throughout the day.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. As I said in some of my previous commons, actually doing some small  things to help prevent environment change can be extremely important for us, but I also think that the power of a single person can be limited in many ways. Thus, just like what I always say, it is important to inform others around us to join the process of protecting the environment. We are really lucky to have the chance to get into this course and learn all these knowledge about the climate crisis and what to do, so we need to tell as many people as possible around us about the information and try to let them join us to make a bigger difference.

From my personal view, every personal action is contributed to all climate activism and politically active. It is true that riding a bicycle will just decrease the tons of carbon dioxide that the public created every day. Driving, heating, burning gas…. all of the decisions that people choose will all appeal to the same conclusion. There will just have more pollution right now but also the future. The carbon dioxide and the sulfuric dioxide produced from the factory that people created will just contribute just more population. For me, as a student at UCSB. I decide my choice to ride a bike to school every day instead of driving. Though I do have a license that I could drive anywhere I want. I still decided to rent a car for the weekend if I want to visit LA or Irvine. I hope what I did can just decrease my personal carbon emission or any other environmental pollution to the most. Yeah, all the climate change is all contributing to people’s decision. So just be proud of yourself and keep on going.

I agree with you on the basis that personal action contributes to climate and political activism. Although it is true that all three of these are connected to one another, I believe that political activism has the most influence on the other two. As we saw once Trump was elected as president, racial remarks and his overall political views became more prevalent among the general public (more so southern and red states). That being said, it is evident that many would take on and support the ideologies of their political leader, whether it be state representatives, senators, or the president. If the most popular politicians were to demonstrate concern in regards to the climate crisis, I would assume that their followers would be more open to the idea of using renewable energy sources and part taking in other solutions to the climate crisis. Political leaders could spark climate activism which in turn would spark personal action. Yet again, the political leader must be chosen by the public, so one could also make the argument that personal action is most important.

Speaking on the bike advocate issue that Ken talks about in this video, I myself would get behind this movement as I believe that is an easy and effective way to reduce emissions, all while benefitting the health of the average person. It is never a bad idea to get exercise or fresh air, and I feel like people commuting to work where they will sit inside on a chair all day would actually greatly benefit from this change.  Besides the personal benefits of biking, this is an easy way to reduce emissions (especially in California where we have the ability to be outside in sunshine almost every day of the year). Living in San Diego, I have been exposed to lots of bikers over the years that share the roads with cars (even on the "bike lane" like Ken states are only separated by a white line). Not only is this terrifying as a 16 year old who was learning how to drive as I was so afraid I would hit someone because they are so close to the car lane, but it is so dangerous and not ideal for those people that are reducing emissions to have to put up with this scary consequence. I think advocating for bike lanes and making it easier to be a part of this movement is crucial, and coming from UCSB kids who know bikes best I believe it is our job to spread this notion!!

Biking is great- it fulfills exercise, helps the environment and in LA, would probably shave off 20 minutes at least in commuting. In Santa Barbara biking is essential at least to the heart of the university but in other places of Santa Barbara cars of essence because there are not always bike lanes in certain parts leading to the people biking on car lanes. I think that instead of advocating for bike lanes we should add bike lanes behind parked cars to make riding bikes around Santa Barbara more safe and limits the amount of possible car accidents and make biking safer as a whole. As a bike advocating campus it is safe to say that accidents are very common and as a community we need to take into consideration how popular accidents are. Especially in the smaller parts of IV, there are no bike lanes but bikes use the roads more than cars do. We should as a community cut down carbon that is possible, because biking is so common here, it is easier to make the switch.


<br><hr>
I really love your idea about having bike lanes behind parked cars instead as I also feel as though it is a huge safety issue. I myself have felt very unsafe while biking on busy streets, and in downtown Santa Barbara there is no way that I could go along the main road and not feel extremely uncomfortable and afraid that I might get hit. I completely agree that as a community we should all be biking especially because of the accessibility of bikes and bike paths in Isla Vista. I think it is terrifying that there are accidents with cars and bikes as the biker is clearly not protected from the impact at all and it could be an accident that happens in a second and is very likely it will be fatal.

I still think that personal action is incredibly important and attainable but I definitely think that personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically involved go hand in hand. Personal action I think is easier to implement because it is your personal life and you can change something in your daily routine to help out in the climate crisis, as well as talk to others as to what it is that you are implementing and perhaps they could make changes as well, although this could occur within climate activism and being politically involved as well. However, I do think that being an activist could potentially be incredibly dangerous such as in the case of the activists in Brazil who went against the Beef industry and were murdered for trying to go against it. So I think that the simplest ways to help would be through personal action and through political involvement.

To answer Ken’s questions about the relative importance of personal action versus voting as a strategy for mitigating climate change, I think it is, though it may sound harsh, hypocritical to participate in one but not the other. While none of us are perfect and we all undoubtedly make decisions that negatively impact the climate in one way or another, we can always improve our personal habits related to fossil fuel production and diet, among other things. Firstly, I think we should all rejoice in the fact that we all have the ability to vote and help shape the future of the planet in ways that millions of others will never get the chance. We should feel lucky and eager to make our voices heard. The argument that one doesn’t need to vote because “one vote won’t make a difference” is an asinine, bullshit excuse that needs to be forgotten once and for all. There have been many elections and bill proposals that have been decided by incredibly narrow margins throughout the course of history, which all could have been changed had a few more individuals casted their vote during that voting cycle. In my opinion, if you can vote and simply choose not to do so, you are doing a massive disservice to yourself and every other life on the planet, human or not. Polar bears do not get a vote. Endangered rhinos do not get a vote. The Indonesian and Amazon Rainforests do not get a vote. The unborn children of future generations to come do not get a vote. But YOU DO, so you had better take full advantage of it! 

<br><br>

Furthermore, as Ken suggested, simply voting cannot be paralleled by a general lack of effort to make personal changes towards the climate effort. We must mimic, advocate for, and make the changes we are voting for. If we are going to come after politicians and fossil fuel CEOs for knowingly continuing to pump fossil fuels out of the Earth despite the obvious harm it is causing our planet, then we better damn well stop eating so many burgers (among other things, but you get my point)! The hypocrisy we allow ourselves to perpetuate under these circumstances would be almost comical if we didn’t have only about a decade left to save our planet from irreversible destruction and mayhem. Here we are, driving massive SUVs with one person inside round trip to and from work, 100 miles round trip for some (and some even further) every day; stopping at McDonalds or In and Out after a long day because we “deserve it” (deserve what, heart disease and a dying planet? Because if that’s what we’re after we should keep this up unchecked); shopping online for a new bikini because the one from last year isn’t “in style” anymore; or any number of other seemingly normal activities that serve only to fuel this unsustainable mode of lifestyle. But voting for candidates who support the changes we ourselves refuse to make is enough right? In case you missed my point, the answer is HELL no.  

<br><br>

So what’s to be done? As Ken discussed at length, personal change and advocacy must work in tandem with active and educated voting to force politicians to recognize the massive increase in public interest and start taking real political action. This is in fact how most of the updated biking paths in downtown Santa Barbara came to be in the first place. That’s not to say that we are anywhere near close to a local solution to the problem of carbon emissions from transportation. This will still take mass demand and advocacy to achieve on a level wide enough to make the use of bike paths a realistic alternative to driving. So that’s where we have to start. Start with ourselves and our own behaviors and then DEMAND that politicians follow suit. Do not let up, we can’t afford to let this fight go.

It is really cool and inspiring to see small cities, like Copenhagen, being so successful and progressive in their efforts to mitigate climate change. It helps us understand that while completely turning world  economies and cultures around needs to happen on a national and even international level, there is also a lot that we as individuals can be doing to spark change in our own communities and communities around us. The fact that Copenhagen saves about 3.8 billion tons of CO2 emissions every year due to 62% of people biking to work or school is crazy to think about. Imagine what even bigger and more densely populated cities in the US could do if the majority of people commuted by bike. This is inspiring in a sense that when everyone comes together and makes change together, real, positive effects come out of it. 
<br><br>
 I think that it is important to think about how all three of these approaches to mitigating climate change are intertwined and related. Personal change can be thought of as changing your  diet, consuming less, changing your mode of transportation, etc. However, personal action can also be considered becoming more active politically as well as acting more as a climate activist. These things are all necessary to create real change, and I think that everything stems from  personal action. Personal action inspires collective action which influences the polls which decides which leaders are elected into office who get to determine what our nation does to help the planet. If a small city like Copenhagen can make such a huge difference, then  the potential that the rest of the world has is endless and there is so much hope for our future as long as we start changing now.

I agree that Copenhagen sets a great example for the rest of the world to follow.  However, I feel it is important to note that Copenhagen has some advantages that allow for this cultural change.  For example, they are a relatively small city compared to many population centers worldwide, which also means the city is relatively smaller.  This makes biking to work a manageable endeavor for most people.  This is much more problematic in suburbia, where you can live up to 40 miles away from work and there are no good bike paths between cities.  So while I believe more people should bike, I also understand how it is not always viable.  

<br><br>

I also enjoyed Ken's point regarding the relations between the three methods to mitigating climate change.  Personal change is necessary to promote politicians who feel obliged to support these activists.  If enough people change their lifestyle, politicians could vote for measures that would be far more effective than any amount of personal involvement (such as banning fracking).  Copenhagen is a good example of this, and should be observed as a beneficial example of what can happen when the people act.

If I'm being honest, my attempts at switching to a plant-based diet have been unsuccessful. I grew up eating meat for every dinner, and animal-products such as dairy and eggs for pretty much every lunch. It's almost as though my body has developed a dependence on animal products. While I've been able to cut down the amount of red meat I eat, no matter how hard I try I always seem to go back to eating chicken, turkey, fish, dairy, and eggs. I know it's possible for me to become vegetarian or vegan, but it would honestly be very hard for me. I figure once I'm out of college, it should be easier. I'll be able to go to grocery stores with the mindset of avoiding animal-products and I'll be able to pick out all of the fruits, vegetables, and grains I'm craving to create delicious and filling vegetarian/vegan dishes! That seems a lot easier to do rather than walking into the dining hall and having to force yourself to eat rice, potatoes, or sautéed vegetables when there are already-made burgers, pizza, chicken tacos, tri-tip sandwiches, cake, and fettuccine alfredo all warm, ready-to-eat, and staring right at you! 
<br><br>

I can't be the only person who has a hard time going vegan/vegetarian. It's a big change. Food is one of the most important parts of every-day life. Therefore, I understand what Mann means when he says that focusing on meat is ignoring the gorilla in the room. Becoming vegan would help, but in the end, compared to other solutions, it is less sellable, less feasible, and less effective.
<br><br>

On the other hand, biking as an alternative to driving is a solution I find very appealing and exciting! 
<br><br>
Before coming to UCSB, I never biked. I never even had a bike (besides a tricycle I used when I was a little kid). Therefore, I just drove everywhere -- even if it was to my friend's house a couple streets away. 

<br><br>
Now that I’m here at UCSB, I love biking. I love getting where I need to go without harming the environment. I also love feeling the breeze on my skin, listening to music, and getting my daily exercise in. It makes me feel so healthy and productive! The idea of going home this summer and biking to my friends' houses, to the grocery store, to restaurants, etc. is something that I would look forward to. However, I know that it won't be a reality. I am too scared. Here at UCSB, we have bike paths and there aren't really any cars around. The most I'm worried about is bumping into someone at the round-about and scraping my legs. Meanwhile, at home, I'd be worried about dying. In my town, there are VERY FEW bike paths, and the ones that exist are extremely small and right next to the car lanes. As much as I would like to, I would NEVER bike in my hometown. It's extremely dangerous and as much as I want to help the environment, I don't want to get hit by a car either. This is saddening, but also inspiring. If only the roads in my hometown were more accommodating to bikers, I would bike EVERYWHERE for the REST OF MY LIFE! And I'm sure if safe and efficient bike paths were more advertised and implemented, others would feel the same way. This gives me hope -- we just have to transform that hope into action.

I can totally understand this feeling of yours. I also tried to go vegetarian and it did not work out either. It even felt like I was starving but I’m sure it was just because I was not approaching this change in the right way. But then again with these dining commons having delicious food on sight, it even makes me sad because I do not enjoy the salad I am eating. I also think it is less effective since we are all used to what we eat, especially our bodies. The way we generate chemical reactions to power our body are very important and we have adapted to generate them through the foods we are used to eating. Making a change can also force the body to struggle to adapt and times it can be both physically and mentally unhealthy. I also agree that biking is a great alternative. I really like the fact that ken mentioned how it can help become more active. Most people do not even walk more than 5000 steps a day and that’s very little physical activity. Has a biology major I can explain how being active even if it just biking can positively affect the circulatory system and nervous system and prevent diseases that at times have irreversible damage. I also love biking and if I do not feel like biking then I will walk. I have a car but I only use it to go home. Otherwise ill bike to food places or a friend’s house and if I need groceries I take the bus cause public transportation is better.

I have had similar experiences to you. I recently cut out all beef from my diet, and am trying to limit my meat intake as a whole. However, merely giving up beef has been a struggle for me because of my beef pho addiction (Vietnamese soup with beef broth and slices of beef). So yeah, pho is now my guilty pleasure in this case. However, knowing how little this really contributes to the climate crisis, I feel kind of pathetic.
<br><br>

In regards to biking, I completely agree about the health/productivity benefits! Especially in cities with an abundance of walkers, I would assume biking would be a popular form of transportation. On the other hand, the danger aspect is really what would hinder me from biking as well. If a car was going 50+ mph literally 5 feet away from you, how would you feel? I for sure know I probably wouldn't put myself in that position in the first place. Moreover, I agree with Ken that society is not built for bicycle riders. When he was speaking about bike lanes, I immediately thought of Copenhagen before he had brought it up, and how industrial paths built specifically for bikes. Honestly, if my hometown in the Central Valley had bike paths like that, I feel like there would be no need for a car at all. I’d probably feel cool riding on the bike path. We (humans) must make bike riding a normality! It is a movement that I would for sure want to take part in, but again, I don't know if I want to put my life on the line like that; there's only so much a helmet can do...

In terms of voting, when I think of voting, the first thing that pops into my mind is the presidential election. Now that I know how important voting on the local level is as well, I will definitely be looking more into that. From my high school experience, mine and my peers’ knowledge on what happens on the local level was limited-to-none. If this is the case of others, I think a lot of people are unaware of the fact that they could do their part by voting on local levels. This brought awareness towards how I can extend my role in mitigating climate change, and how many others can easily do the extra research into what goes on in their hometowns.

I completely agree with the overarching theme of this lecture. While changing what you do on a daily basis in terms of the choices of what you eat, being politically active to drive change is the number one thing that you can do. I myself turned 18 just last year and I have never been able to participate in the voting process until now. This excites me in the scope that even though my one vote is miniscule in proportion to the votes of the masses, I can still rest assured that I tried to make the change I want to see in the country. I am going to be completely honest, I don't personally like an Presidential candidate due to the polarizing natures of the majority of them. Many people may have this mindset and then choose to not vote because they don't know that they have a chance to make a difference at state and local levels as well. A common theme among my comments is education, and once again I will state that change will only happen if we improve the lower levels of the educational system.

I want to start off by the idea made by Ken about how we should view the climate crisis.  He said that we need to view it as a black and white issue to narrow our focus.  I could not agree more I think that the reason why climate change is such a controversial topic is due to the fact that it is very broad.  Broad meaning that there are way too many causes and solutions.  A lot of people know some cause and even probably more solutions but again there is always many more to discuss.  I think that legislation can not hit every one of these causes and solutions so they broaden the idea when trying to advocate for it and many people can not see in between the black and white lines of the issue.  I think that is why many people do nothing really about climate change because they do not know what to do because there are too many solutions and they want to do one but do not know which one is the most effective to do in their life.

The discussion of whether personal actually brought up by professor Hiltner is interesting. I always thought people being environmentally friendly, such as using eco light bulbs, recycling, and having a clean diet was helping the environment albeit it's a small amount. When I learned that they are basically worthless because so many other things cancel them out I was saddened truly. On the bright-side this week's lecture showed that even if you're an extremely busy individual you can fight the climate crisis in a meaningful way by only committing a couple hours a year by voting. The way we destroy our environment with fossil fuels is brought upon largely by fracking and it wont change by itself. It requires legislative change. A lot of the individuals in charge are extremely ignorant at the problem at hand and need to lose their position and job. This is where we come in. We can truly make a change by voting for individuals who will make the change we want, and we can vote for laws that promote the efforts to fight climate change.  Voting is a simple process that everyone can do and should. It decides your future and if you're the type of person that complains about issues in America but don't actually vote then you're part of the problem. Go out and vote!

I have always been an avid biker as a means of transport, but it was for very different reasons than the ones Ken mentioned in his video. I think that biking is an amazing example of a change of infrastructure that will not only help heal our planet and our communities, it will also visibly have other feel-good and useful pros to those who may not see climate change as a pressing issue due to their political, religious, or ideological beliefs. This brings up the notion that we still have to translate many of these issues and find ways of communicating them to the general public. Ken discusses the immense importance of voting in the USA, but there are two very different sides to voting on environmental issues. Many conservatives see the governmental regulations aiming to help the environment as “imposing” onto their own personal freedoms. Many fail to see the long term effects of these policies in this sense. I still 100% agree that voting is one of the most important things you can do, but I think we need to educate and communicate with ALL voters about the environmental issues being addressed in government so that they are not swayed by wealthy millionaires and billionaires using the magic wand of advertising to bippity boppity boop environmental laws and justice out of existence. I feel that we haven’t discussed ways of doing this enough in class, and I’d like to know more about environmental communication and posing climate rhetoric to the vast population of climate change deniers in the US. I think that personal action is very important as it can have an unseen butterfly effect on the people and the world around us. I think that climate activism is also extremely important to convey the severity and the messages we are trying to get across, especially in speaking out for those who don’t have a voice and who have not been the cause of these issues. I think that political activism will bring a lot of change if we can be consistent in our drive and movements. Most importantly though, I think we need to find a way to communicate within ourselves and the world to find a new dialogue that can actually drive this change into a new frontier. There is a disconnect, and it cannot just be ignored as much as we would like to pretend that it is not there, or make enemies of those who think differently. We have to find ways to convey messages, whether through leading through example like in our personal actions, or making a political statement, or even through building blocks in our communities, we have to work together to do it.

I do think personal action is important, but I believe that when we take action, we should focus on our behaviors in daily life. There is one kind of action I hate the most, which is the way Greta Thunberg chose. Her speech is great, but her actions are nothing but making more people hate topics about global warming. No one ruins her childhood; it is just herself who cannot concentrate on her life and want to escape from real life. We all should protect the environment but we should not give up technology and economic development as well. What we shall do is to find a balance between those important developments which will gradually destroy our environment and our daily behaviors which will help us improve our living conditions. I also want to mention that life on earth is a cycle. Not eating meat is not a good way to protect the environment but making things worse. Imagine, if snakes and cats do not prey mouses anymore, the populations of the mouses will improve tremendously, they will destroy and eat everything they see. Is that a good condition? definitely no.

Sometimes I observe our little bubble that is UCSB, and I think about if the entire world could be like our campus. We are a very bike-friendly and oriented environment. We are young people who are politically motivated, eager for change, and accepting of the challenge to save the world. Our bright minds are the minds of the future; we could produce someone who cures cancer, who becomes the next president, or someone who could help stop climate change. We already do so much here, I just want our efforts to be transferred to other counties, states, countries, nations. I want our parents to acknowledge our efforts, and vote politically to save their children's futures, and our children's futures. UCSB has inspired me to become more politically inclined by requiring all of us to register to vote. I vote to change the way our future is headed.

I agree! I received a culture shock when I moved to college last quarter. My hometown is fairly conservative and rural. Many of our people are fierce meat eaters,  hard-core Republicans, conservative thinkers, and climate change deniers. No one bikes unless they're trying to lose weight and no one takes the bus unless they're too poor to own a car (obviously a stigma). The very small population of vegetarians or vegans at my high school were well-known and long suffering. Reusable bags stuck out like a sore thumb and labeled your "hippy". And then I came to UCSB where not only was reusable products used, but they were commonplace. It wasn't anything special or odd to walk or bike or be vegan;  no one even blinked. Single use plastic is shunned and avoided in Isla Vista and on campus, recycling and composting is everywhere, and there are delicious no-meat options in every dining hall. It was so weird compare to my high school that had no recycling cans anywhere, and a heart vegetarian option comprised of an apple and steamed carrots for lunch every day. The normality of political activism, green living, and community involvement was something I had never seen before and something I continue to be amazed at. The Food Co-Op is so cool! And the girls in my dorm who meet in the kitchen Monday nights and make vegan cookies for the whole floor are the cool kids. It made me start thinking of ways to change things my own community at home. I emailed the head of our high school environmental club and have kept him updated on the cool things we have learned in his class, some of the lessons which he will try to implement in the club activities and his APEs classes. While being stuck at home all quarter sucks (whoops revealing how late this comment is) I'm excited to see how I can change my personal life and community habits for the better in the future.

I thought the comparison between the US and Copenhagen, in regards to normalizing cycling as a mode of transportation, was perfect and perfectly plausible in the distant (or hopefully near) future. In Ken’s video, he notes that 62% of the population of Copenhage times 4.2 metric tons per car ⇒ reduction of 3.8 billion lbs of CO2 emissions per year. It was shocking to hear how large of a difference a change as minuscule as the way we get from Point A to Point B could make in our environment.

I was surprised and intrigued by how quickly Copenhagen adapted to the bike culture. To see so many actions (bike lanes being set up, car-free Sundays, and more) are carried out in such a short span of time really shows the dedication and determination of the community and activists of Copenhagen. Ken explored the relationship between individual actions and collective actions, and I believe both are essential and there will not be significant progress with the absence of either. Like you said, sometimes a small change could lead to significant impact collectively, so it is crucial for people to realize how meaningful their actions could be. At the same time, people should look into approaches that lead to legislative and policy changes to solve problems outside of their reach.

I find it truly commendable what Copenhagen was able to do so easily in comparison to the rest of the world. Changing infrastructure is probably one of the most difficult things to accomplish , which is why we  still go by the imperial system and why our public transit is often terrible. However, I feel as if implementing new bike paths can't be awfully costly in comparison those other things. It's also fascinating how such a seemingly minute change can have such substantial effects on our planet, which is why I'm eager to act now. Yes, me changing alone will not have any where near a substantial effect on the planet, but it's important to start somewhere. It's not a matter of how much I'm saving, it's the fact that I am saving. By just following the practice, I am slowly coercing others to act similarly which is where the true action begins;. If we encourage people that personal action isn't necessary, then they will likely become complacent and act as if the problem isn't their concern to begin with. Once again, this obviously seems like the wrong approach because it delegitimizes the issue 
<br><br>
Even then, I do now acknowledge how important it is to vote for people that will initiate policies to preserve the planet. As cynical as it is, I know some people will never change unless we make it their only option. I believe that change can be made, we just have to start now.

Well said, champ. I agree with you on the notion that individual action could be equally important as collective action such as a policy change. In the case of Copenhagen, people pushed for bike paths despite the governors' unwillingness to modify and improve on existing infrastructure. If nobody cared about riding bikes, there wouldn't be any bike paths and reduction in carbon emission. That's why I believe individual actions and collective actions are inextricably related, one encourages the other and vice versa, forming a cycle that leads to change.

Ok, IV and UCSB, Y'ALL NEED TO VOTE! The election is on Tuesday, March 3rd, the same day as the presidential primary here. Joan Hartmann, our current county supervisor (3rd district) is a climate activist, so you better vote her in again. Like Ken suggested with Copenhagen, Hartmann is working on improving bike lanes in SB and around campus! Other candidates and offices are SUPER important too. There are so many polling locations on campus and tons of info floating around, so you have no excuse to vote if you're eligible to vote (and if you're not eligible to vote, encourage your friends who are eligible to get their butts out there to vote!). I'm not exaggerating when I say our lives depend on your vote. Environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace endorse candidates up and down the ballot and you can go on candidates' websites and see what you think of them for yourself. It only takes a few minutes and you can do it while going to the bathroom (I know you're on your phone anyway in there, so why not make it productive). Don't think you'll make an impact in our elections? THINK AGAIN! The district that we all live in is the 3rd district. There are 5 districts in the SB area for the Board of County Supervisors. 2 districts are solidly Republican and 2 districts are solidly Democratic. The 3rd District (OUR DISTRICT) is the swing vote! AND, the most important voting bloc of that district is the UCSB campus and IV residents. UCSB and IV is LITERALLY where the race comes down to EVERY SINGLE ELECTION. Since we are the swing vote and the students here have the biggest impact in deciding which way this district goes, the students have the biggest impact in what the County Board of Supervisors does. THIS IS REAL POWER Y'ALL!!! What local governments do is CRITICALLY important in helping the planet, especially in Santa Barbara. 
<br><br>
Ballots are already in the mail (so please check your PO Box or your mail box). If you vote in person, the ballot information is already in the mail. Know where your polling location is (and if you vote by mail, you can drop off your mail-in ballot at ANY polling location!) and MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE.

Voting is so important. I couldn't a free more. Recently I have gotten very involved in UCSB for Bernie. This video discusses the insanely high methane emissions from fracking, which Bernie plans to ban. Also he is running with he Green New Deal on his ticket. Being involved in politics - especially for young people - is so important because policy can do so much. I am trying to work on the issues I care about ( the climate crisis, immigration, climate injustice and others) from the ground up. I work with different activist groups, however I strongly believe that a political on my side makes such a difference. I have been working on getting people registered to vote, and promoting Bernie Sanders.
<br><br>
I also am working on personal action - not flying is hard for me but due to this class and my other environmental classes, I am rethinking my potential trip this spring break to New Orleans and replacing it with something more local. I have been vegetarian for 2 years. Recently I reintroduced a little bit of meat into my diet, but I have only reintroduced chicken, and I have decided to cut that out again. I think it is very important that we all do our part, from the ground up, on a personal level as swells s activism if possible, and from the top down with voting.

The personal change is not enough to save our planet, I think it's time to tell those fossil fuel companies how bad our environment is. I remember seeing a comparing picture of the earth in 2006 and 2019. The whole earth's surface is different. Only through letting those companies understand the damage of earth, they can rethink their behaviors on the climate. Even the change we do is not enough, but I still believe it is influential.  Even though it can only change a little portion, I still think it's meaningful, and we should continue doing it.

Ken is right, everyone has at least an hour out of the year to take the time to go and vote. Even if one didn’t have the time, it would make sense to find some time to because it is so important. Ken has mentioned before that any sort of change is going to have to take place starting at a local level, from there we can start making national changes. Once we get people comfortable with the idea of potentially biking places and giving up their dependence on fossil fuels the transition will be made to a cleaner way of life. The only way to make sure this later statement will come true is if we all take the time to vote for the politicians and community leaders who support our environment before the big industries. I am thankful Copenhagen has provided an example for the rest of the world, and in particular the U.S. on becoming a clean energy city. They have shown us it can definitely be done, it just takes communities getting together for something that is essential to live, our planet.

The world is facing a climate emergency, and so far, no major polluting country in the world has done everything to avoid the coming disaster. The ecological and social crisis facing the world today is actually two aspects of the crisis of anthropocentric industrial capitalist civilization. In order to resolve the crisis, mankind must take ecological socialism as its future path. Therefore, all attempts to reform today's civilization to address all aspects of the ecosystem, if it is not the ongoing and deepening struggle of self-armed working people—they are holding actions to build a self-organizing and self-mobilizing movement Programmes and strategies to build an eco-socialist society-part of it, will surely fail.Human beings are in the transition period from industrial civilization to ecological civilization. History has reached a key turning point-whether to choose a sustainable development method of energy saving and "green" environmental protection, or continue to focus on maximizing self-interest while not looting natural resources and destroying the traditional growth mode of ecological environment. The financial crisis has spurred the international community: indignant greed in human nature is the culprit leading to multiple crises such as finance, resources, and the environment, and new moral dams must be constructed with new policies. Choosing green development means to encourage the development of a green economy from a policy perspective, and to develop the economy within the limits of the natural system's self-recovery in order to protect and improve the ecological environment and realize the harmonious development of man and nature.

You made a very good point about actions and transition. Copenhagen has set up a really good example of a city that has a transportation sector that's relatively green, but it maybe really hard for the U.S. to adopt its way of doing right away because private car usage is so embedded in the American culture. It's going to take time, but little by little the public could be encouraged to bike around instead of driving, and over a period of time people will get used to it and it wouldn't be so much of a cultural shift that people will resist. The transition process is definitely really important. Like you said, communities should get together and encourage each other to tackle the problems of emission from the transportation sector on a local level.

I am totally agree with your view that Ken is right about the fact that “everyone has at least an hour out of the year to take the time to go and vote”. Admittedly, an individual’s voting is not influential enough to initiation a revolutionary movement on environmental problems. Nevertheless, the adds up of the majority’s voting could bring a rapid overhaul on politics. Ken emphasizes in the lecture that the simplest thing one can do to protect the earth is to vote for politicians who admit human activity is the major culprit to the climate change and are in favor of making some changes to reduce the emission of CO2. Usually, we, the young teenagers, would consider ourselves having feeble powers on electing politicians. But, the truth is once we stick together, we can account for nearly 20% of voting, which is enough to sway the leaders in the election. Once we choose politicians who are willing to take actions on reducing climate change, then we can have an access on implementing the Green New Deal and other resolutions which are helpful for reducing the emission of CO2. Copenhagen is a good example to prove the above argument. It successfully shifts their popular means of transportation from private car to bicycle by enhancing their transport conditions by building cycle tracks on Main Roads for riding bicycles. It is true that riding bicycles can avoid traffic jams and are convenient for parking comparing to the private cars. But why people are unwilling to ride bicycles in U.S? Bicycle commuting is not very practical in many American locales may well be one of the reasons. But I highly believe the poor conditions for riding plays the predominant role in discouraging people commuting via bicycles in that Ken mentioned his own anecdote that, for his commutation, he has to ride on the unprotected shoulder with traffic moving along at 50 miles an hour besides him, which is very dangerous. Thus, once we can vote for politicians who decide to make revolutionary changes on politics to reduce climate change, the problems such as poor riding conditions can be solved and more people are encouraged to commute via cycling to reduce the emission of exhausted gases.

Up until now, I used to think that personal action and climate activism were  vastly different things. However, I now have the belief that these are almost one in the same, and we need to do more of it if something is to change. Personal action to me means making plant based diet changes, biking somewhere instead of driving, or even installing solar panels in your home. However, all these things are apart of the idea of climate activism/being politically active, as they are a means to enter. What i mean by that is that people who do things like this might see the good effects that it can have on their lives, and then will in turn go out and vote and be active in fighting to them to be everywhere since they themselves have seen the benefits. When first moving to UCSB, I was very nicely greeted by the bike path infrastructure that the school offers. I originally intended to skateboard everywhere as it was a goal of mine to be good at skateboarding, but some of the rough terrain and the skate lane being overdue for new concrete has put me off of the idea temporarily. However, the bike lane has made it incredibly easy to get around campus, especially living in the dorms and needing to go to IV or Goleta for anything that is not school related. The bike lanes cover most areas of campus, and while some people are bad and biking when its crowded, that is  to be expected since not everyone is as confident in their abilities. Rather than walking from the dorms on one edge of campus to the beginning of IV, which is a 20 minute walk, I can take my bike and be there in 5 minutes. This is extremely helpful in a number of ways. For instance, my legs get a small workout, i am able to cover more distance in shorter times, and my bike was only a total of $30 to me since I purchased it for cheap from a garage sale. I think that in order for people to accept things like riding a bike to work instead of taking a car, the infrastructure needs to be in place so that there is a low barrier of entry for those that really want to make a switch. Many a time i have wanted to do something out of my element, but have been discouraged by the learning curve and time needed to make it an enjoyable and viable use of my time. While this might not be the end of the world for some things, I think that taking the time to invest in our climate will not only positively effect us as individuals but will enhance the world we live in.

I believe that all three are important in their own right. Both personal action and climate activism are a reflection of becoming politically active and vice versa. By promoting only one, you are also promoting the other two. In addition, a development in one section can have long-lasting benefits in the promotion of the other two methods. To borrow Ken's example,  becoming politically active about the reinforcement of biking infrastructure will allow others to take personal action and start biking easier. As a result, they may develop a passion in biking and become active in promoting biking. Similarly, taking personal action in biking in an area with poor biking infrastructure may inspire others to take similar action as well as become politically involved in biking infrastructure matters so that people like you aren't harmed in biking accidents.
<br><br>

I like how Ken brings in the importance of voting. While it may seem to be less of a commitment than becoming a dedicated bicyclist, voting has a profound impact of the lives of not only ourselves but of others around us as well. Voting is probably the single most important action that an individual can take. Voting has such a broad impact on life that can't be expressed in a few words. It opens pathways for the underprivileged and saves others from having to make life-ruining decisions. It is imperative that we take matters into our own hands and vote.

After watching Ken’s video, Personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active. Which matters more?, I realized how important my daily actions actually were. I turned 18 just last year and haven’t gotten the chance to vote yet, but I have always planned to vote since becoming eligible. I knew that my vote was important to create an impact, but I never really realized that it was this significant until Ken’s video. If we strongly believe a voting option, we can propose that idea to other people and try and convince them, and your beliefs can spread by word of mouth and reach so many more people. Many people don’t want to or can’t change their daily lifestyle with eating habits, but if you’re eligible to vote, it is really easy to register and go vote. As Ken has mentioned multiple times, it is important to share this information with the people around us, even if it is just at a local level. If we all share it with the people around us, the impact can be much greater and the news about how to solve the climate crisis can be spread to significantly more people. Although it helps, we don’t need to be famous to make a difference. As long as we work toward sharing this information and following it, we can all educate more people about this crisis and work toward solving this devastating state of the earth that this earth is slowly becoming.

I completely agree with your comment. Small actions such as educating your friends or family members about the topic does, in fact, have a meaningful impact and by discussing the topic, it may cause a domino effect where the information is spread to more and more people; thereby helping promote the cause.

After taking Ken's lectures,  I have learnt not only how to protect out environment but also how to protect and use our civil rights. You might ask why our civil rights are related to our civil rights? It does affect a lot. We have our rights to breathe clean air, to drink clean water, to have clear blue sky. Once these rights disappear, our civil rights are also being harmed. Ken mentioned cow industries that methane from cow dung will increase global warming quickly. These kinds of farming industries exist in many countries, but no one ever points them out due to powers behind these industries. 
<br><br>
Many people are indifferent about what is happening in the world as their homelands are not influenced. However, it has already happened in many places: In Miami, big storms made half of the city underwater. That disaster caused billions of loss to the government. Here are some suggestions to protect your civil rights: 1. become politically active, not only for you but also for your future generations. 2. become climate activism, save our world by engaging more into climate activities. 3. start a whole new healthy lifestyle including biking more and consuming less meat. Among these three suggestions, i think becoming politically active is more important as it can help us engage in different environmental policies which affect the climate directly.

I agree, this class has made me more aware of what is going on around us and more inclined to take action. This reminds me of a quote from a German pastor during the Nazi reign:
<br><br>

 “First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.” -Martin Niemöller
<br><br>

Many of the major consequences of the climate crisis will not affect Americans. We have the resources to fight them. However, if we do not help the countries that will be affected the most, then we will have no one to help us. Speaking out and taking action for political issues that you believe in is so important. Change is never created when people sit silently by. I believe voting is very important, but so is being an activist and speaking for those who do not have a voice.

Listening to how Copenhagen was able to adopt a more sustainable form of inspiration kind of gave me a little sense of hope that maybe we can change our ways and so something that will put out environment first for once. It says a lot now knowing that Copenhagen was able to change their ways on a local scale. The power of the people is undefeated. Knowing what we know about climate change and how our impending doom is in our schedule, this should be pushing people to do more. It should make people reflect on their behaviors and lifestyle. We have to power to vote for politicians who are for change and for the environment. I personally know people who are choosing not to vote simply because they believe that their vote means nothing. This is something that should be addressed because their vote does matter and them not voting for issues they believe in gives older generations the power to write our future. This isn’t how it should be and it should change because our efforts when it comes to voting matters. When knowledge is acted, that’s when change can be expected.

I too gained hope from the turnaround that Copenhagen did. They were able to make personal changes, that eventually lead to government change in order to make it more safe for them to travel. It made me wonder if the U.S. were to have a surge of biking would that lead to the government endorsing changes that would make the U.S. more bike friendly.
<br><br>


 I also agree with Molly that the power of the people is undefeated as Copenhagen proves. Voting is an important aspect of fighting the climate crisis but like Ken said we can't just do that. We have to do personal actions, climate change activism and be politically active. I am very excited to say that since becoming a UCSB student I have resorted to biking and the bus system. When I go home I go on the train, bus, or a rideshare. When elections come up, I do my part and vote for the best candidate. The part I do feel I am lacking in is my climate activism. I try to educate my family and friends on climate issues but I definitely feel like and I could and should do more.

Being politically active is the most important. Of all the methods we’re aware of, it’s not enough to help climate change alone. The likelihood of the population to even attempt trying to switch to a plant based diet or focus on the beef industry is very little voluntarily. But, having someone with a platform can cause a huge reduction. Ken mentioned two other advocates commenting on how focusing on specifically individual consumer behavior is not enough, neither is focusing on the beef industry. The best we could do is aim towards decreasing the leading cause of climate change, transportation. Mass and public transportation contributes the most to CO2 emissions. If we find a candidate who is just as involved in the climate than in politics, then I see potential in expanding the word. Having someone with an audience will spread our message even further and to new places, in turn, potential for new action and effort. Personal action and climate activism is just as important but becoming political active will cause the most change.

I completely agree. Even if we make a complete overhaul in our own ways, it will rarely have an impact on the impending crisis. This is because not everyone will adapt on their own without education, support, or enforcement. However, even by the simple act of broadcasting your own story, you may be able to connect to your community, increasing you impact by 10x to 100xs more. To me, on a larger scale, this is what climate activism, and any political activism looks like. When people go out and stand out for what they believe in, it gathers attention with the media and community members, creating a network of people now invested in the issue. When these issues become large enough recognized, citizens can gather the attention of politicians and push for actions. Although electing officials and implementing policy, as both you and Ken note, is the ultimate goal of all political activism, it is important to remember how much of an impact even just having discussions with your community can be. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, I agree with your analysis of the public transportation issue. I agree that it is one of the most important issues to target, although it will take massive governmental action. However, I agree that the key to this is the right candidate.

There were a lot of great points that Ken brought up, but one of them stood out to me the most: we don't need to be famous or well-known to make a difference.
<br><br>
It's definitely easier said than done, but it really is true; as Ken mentioned, Greta Thunberg was just an average high school students not a long time ago. There are three main ways in which we can make a difference: be an activist, be politically active, or change our personal lifestyles.
<br><br>
Being politically active is something I believe that we can all be. Voting, for example, is an efficient way for us to voice our beliefs that we need a politician who can implement environmentally friendly policies. Ken argues in the video that state, city, and local elections all make a huge impact, as we can advocate for policies that will affect us right here locally. For example, Mark Ruffalo produced a short documentary directed to Governor Brown to show his stance to stop fracking in California. Although Governor Brown declined, it still illustrates how we can be politically active in our society. 
<br><br>
Being an activist or changing our personal lifestyles are also efficient methods. Ken does concede that switching to a plant-based diet won't completely solve the release of methane into the atmosphere, as the problem won't fully end even if every single person on the planet stopped consuming meat products, although it would significantly help. However, we can definitely change certain parts of our lifestyles, such as changing our methods of transportation. Biking is a much more sustainable option than driving, and it is safer and healthier as well.

I definitely agree with you that anyone can advocate for a change they want to see. You don’t need to be famous to get the word out, and the actions of the many can overpower those trying to inhibit climate sensitive legislature. However, it doesn’t hurt when people with a lot more influence than us advocate for the same cause. Gretta Thunberg is an odd case though, she is advertised as an average student who cares about the state of our planet, but you have to understand that everything that has been happening to her is no coincidence. As weird as it sounds, she was specially selected by interest groups to speak on their behalf. Let me explain, in a similar way to how Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. were the spokespeople for the civil rights movement, Gretta Thunberg was herself selected to publicly speak for these interests in order to further the goals of global warming activists. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that people are getting the word out to the general public, who are busy with their day to day jobs or whatever to be involved in activism. I just wish that these interest groups would be more forward about their involvement in the current political system. Using people as spokespeople to further their goals is great and all, I just want some transparency. If all of this is sounding like borderline conspiracy theory ask yourself, if Gretta Thunberg was a middle-aged minority, would she receive the same media attention as she does now? What about if she was elderly or had been to jail? Would she still receive the same attention? What if she smoked or did drugs? She was specifically chosen because she practices what she preaches and is seemingly perfect for the role. She is humble, likeable, educated, well spoken, and most of all, she is young. These interest groups know that she will be put under the microscope and that everything she does or says will be critiqued at every step. Those who oppose global warming activism will look for any chance to discredit their opposition. I would rant more about our broken two-party political system, but it would take too long and nobody wants to hear that. 
<br><br>
I also agree that biking, especially at UCSB, is not only environmentally conscious, but an efficient mode of transportation. Prior to being in this class, I rode my bike because I didn’t want to pay for a parking pass and driving seemed like a hassle. With a new perspective I’m grateful that we live in such a bike efficient campus, otherwise I would have most likely brought my car. Well thanks for coming to my ted talk …


<br><hr>
 I couldn't agree more with your points; I also think it's important that people shouldn't discourage themselves from being active simply because they aren't famous or well-known. However, like you mentioned, Greta Thunberg is a pretty rare case, and it would be a lot more effective if well-known/famous people along with interest groups were more active in our political system. I actually was unaware about Greta Thunberg's story of how she became a well-known activist, so I'm surprised to hear how she was selected by an interest group; I also agree that it was because of her background that she was selected, and anything that could possibly ruin her image could've been used against the climate change activists. It's unfortunate that there are people out there that are trying discredit those who are fighting for the planet's well being, especially when it is their planet too.

I wish that switching to a plant based diet would be enough personal action to help with the climate crisis.  The main issue is how we use fossil fuels for energy and transport, which takes action of 2/3s of the global carbon emissions.  It sucks that fossil fuel does more than cause CO2 emissions. It is surprising that something as easy as voting does more to help the environment than going to a plant based diet. Our society needs to focus on doing both. Both are important in different ways. Yes if everyone votes, it would make a significant different. However, if everyone votes and does more climate friendly actions, then the actions would make a huge dent towards helping with the climate crisis. I personally really like biking and taking the public transportation. Everyone, please vote and consider using your car less.

I believe personal actions on climate affect the politics. At the same time, the politics will affect more personal actions. Like transportations and food production, policies only can make large and obvious changes which are beneficial to the environment or citizens. However, I believe personal action and becoming politically active are both important because the politics starts from person and grows into the public. I feel a lot after watches Ken's video. For example, cycling is a personal action because it usually avoids traffic and doesn't have the problem of parking. It is a choice made by people which saves their time and effort. This group of people usually realizes more about the climate crisis and the actions they have to take on reduce the emission of greenhouse gases they produced. This is the personal action of a small group of people who are doing the environmental-friendly actions. However, I feel hopeless on how to change a personal action into a larger group of population action. Again, changing one's habits is not a easy job, unless the new habit can greatly benefits ones on safety, finance, or time. If people can realize riding a bike to work is much cheaper, time-saving, safer, and cost less effort, they would like to switch their way of transportation. However, such as Ken talks about in the video, the shared bicycle routes causes frequent accidents in past decades. It produces potential danger among people. They would think riding is not safe enough; at the same time, the public transportation are usually costing more time and effort. The best solution may be having improvements on urban constructions. The city builds separated riding routes and arranges more frequent and faster buses/trains, until people realizes the public transportation have more advantages as driving private vehicles. In this way, they would change their behaviors. I found that some personal actions are effective on eliminating climate footprints, and becoming politically action would be powerful to promote the actions to the general public.

I completely agree with what Ken is stating here. It’s a little disheartening to learn that our personal changes, like going vegan, isn’t really helping as much as we would want it to or what we think. Sometimes receiving all of this information gets a little confusing because every week we focus on different subjects that relate to the climate crisis and every week I’m told that this specific thing is the leading cause of climate change and the next week it’s something else. For example, the first week I was told that the emissions of fossil fuels is the leading cause, but then last week I was told that the leading cause of climate change was the cattle industry. I was also told that being vegan is one of the most important lifestyle choices that one can make, but now I’m being told it really isn’t? Sometimes the information I receive from this class is just so contradicting and it’s hard for me to really know what is helping solve the climate crisis.

With any major or global issue, I think there is going to be slightly different opinions and suggestions from different professionals because each person has their own unique background and perspective. For example, climate scientists, sociologists, politicians, and activists, although perhaps having similar goals, might have different ideas for what the best solution will be. This is the case because so many factors are considered when deciding what sort of plan to implement, money being one of the biggest ones, followed by resources, cultural aspects, and individual and community desires. By now, the general public knows the main concepts that should be paid attention to when discussing combating climate change, like eating less meat, driving less, wasting less food, and using less plastics or items that will end up in a landfill. There is no doubt that taking any of these actions can have a positive (or at least neutral) impact on our environment and society. Still, there is no question that some, or all, individuals making one lifestyle change is going to undo decades of destruction. Therefore I find it necessary to alter the systems that let continued degradation take place, such as capitalism, racism, and elitism. The people and groups in power with money and influence truly make decisions that affect the world’s population, and until we can do something to change the existing infrastructure and ideologies that have plagued many societies, we are going to have a hard time seeing real progress.

I don't think there is a real answer to that question because all three of these pillars for climate crisis action are strongly interconnected. For example, without climate activism and strong groups advocating for action then the government will not have enough pressure/incentive to act. In the same vain, with less activism, less people will be exposed to the issues of climate change and so their will be less personal/political action.
<br><br>
I think this is the essential overarching problem in our fight to counter climate change. It's such a global problem, it literally encompasses the whole of the earth, each and every one of us, on an individual, corporation and governmental level. The way everything we are and do affects the climate change is so complex and interconnected. If there is one thing I took from this class it is that to save our planet and mitigate the damage we need a sweeping and holistic legislative, cultural, educational and technological changes, (to name a few).

Ken made a good point in addressing that personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active all coexist. None of these are mutually exclusive, and rather efforts to participate in each one of them contribute to greater change, no matter how little impact we suspect our activities have. While personal action seems more insignificant in comparison to climate activism or political activeness, there truly is value behind every decision we make in regards to our planet’s health. Because the climate crisis is a global issue we often feel like our own decisions are helpless in tackling the problem. However, just from taking this course I know that I am more conscious of those “little” decisions I make everyday and have often had it brought up in my everyday conversations with family or friends.
<br><br>
Sharing our knowledge or encouraging others to engage in personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active are important in this issue. It may start as small as you deciding to learn and change, but the more we engage or encourage others to engage, the more and more we begin to see change. Our actions do have value, and we are responsible for the things we decide to do and whether or not we want to do better.

I completely agree with your rationale about the importance of individual action. It is often hard to make sacrifices in our lives for the sake of the climate when we see the majority of other people enjoying the countless luxuries that continue to worsen the crisis. It is also hard to stick with something when we do not see the immediate effects. It feels very good to work hard for something and get rewarded with a good outcome, but that is not the way our climate crisis works. It is not going to mend itself quickly and is especially not going to stop progressing by the personal actions of just one person. However, that should not deter people from altering their lifestyles to be more sustainable. If many people begin to make small changes to their lives, others are going to be indirectly forced to alter their lives as well. People close to you, such as your family, friends, and partner are going to subconsciously begin to change small parts of their lifestyles just by spending time together. For example, if you are choosing to eliminate meat from your diet, you will begin to seek restaurants that offer vegan or vegetarian options as opposed to meat centered restaurants. The people who are enjoying the meal with you will also be exposed to these options and may eliminate meat from their meal as well. Families and friends often pick up similar trends in order to live more homonymous with one another and support each other's needs, so this is why we should not undermine the importance of individual action. It can spread and make more of an impact than we think.

It’s disheartening to think that even if everybody made personal changes, the climate crisis would still be a huge issue. However, most people will not make personal changes, so this crisis remains as crucial of an issue as ever. It will continue being a pressing issue until a larger cultural change is made. Personal action, activism, and being politically active all need to come together in order for progress to happen.

Hearing about Copenhagen’s bicycle transformation really made me think about the drastic improvements that students need to make. I know for me, getting my driver’s license was an extremely exciting time for me. I wanted to use this newfound power, which tempted me to drive everywhere; however, I didn’t. I continued biking most places, and I think the biggest reason for this was my parents making me pay for my own gas. I knew the harsh environmental consequences that followed driving, but even if I didn’t, I felt the harsh consequences from a financial standpoint. Teenagers often times realize the environmental consequences but feel such a rush from driving, causing them to ignore the facts. I had friends who lived a few blocks away from school, yet drove anyways because they thought it was more “convenient”. Parents need to do a much better job of regulating their kids, especially when it comes to driving. For me, paying for my own gas was a great incentive to drive significantly less. I believe that change needs to begin with teenagers and young adults when it comes to reducing the use of cars. If the same number of Americans as people in Copenhagen swapped their cars for bikes, 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 emissions would be reduced. That’s crazy.

I agree. It was really sobering to hear that even if we all made personal changes, it wouldn't solve the climate crisis, keeping in mind that a lot of people won't change their ways of living anyway. I think the note you made about driving was a really good point- as a teenager I saw driving as my newest freedom, so I used it as much as possible. In some aspects I had to, as I worked in a town that I could not safely get to via bike, but i also just drove around in my  free time because I felt like it calmed me down. Now, i realize how detrimental that was to the planet. While I am here at school, I've found that biking has the same calming effect that driving has for me, but it's also much much much better for the environment, better for my health, and, honestly, you can go to a lot cooler places on a bike ride than in a car at some points. I've biked along the beach, in the mountains on paths, places you can't on a car. I think it's an easy change that makes a big impact on not only the environment, but on oneself personally as well.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment and actually have somewhat touched on this issue in last week’s discussion. It isn’t just about making personal changes or legal changes in higher up government. It's like what you said, there needs to be a change in the culture we have here in the U.S. It’s a mindset that people have that holds them back from becoming more environmentally aware. This is the reason that Ken’s suggestions about ditching cars in favor of bicycles is problematic. I couldn’t even begin to imagine telling my parents to bike to work instead of taking a car. And there's another problem. My parents both work way too far away to be able to use a bicycle instead of a car. However, this isn’t to say that they aren’t somewhat conserving. My dad is able to carpool with a few other of his work friends and this is much better than if he was to drive himself to work everyday, which would be much less efficient. 
<br><br>
I also agree with Ken that all elections are important, not just presidential elections or higher up elections. In fact, local elections are some of the most important, especially living in a small town like Santa Barbara. Again, all three actions are important as Ken noted. Activism, personal changes, and political changes are all key to reducing greenhouse gases and trying to save the environment, however it is the mindset of people all across heavily CO2 producing countries like the U.S. that making these small changes won’t really make that much of a difference.
<br><hr>

I really enjoyed reading your comment.  I was also very surprised hearing that if everyone went vegan the climate crisis would still be a very present issue.  This is hard to wrap my head around because not only are many people going to continue supporting the meat industry, but this also means that humans have caused so much damage to the planet that drastic lifestyle changes made would only make a little impact in solving the issue.  I believe that as we begin to learn more about the issue we need to take action and educate others to do the same.  I agree with Ken's point that becoming an activist is very important to spread awareness over the issue and make little differences in the way that each of us negatively affects the planet through our carbon footprint.  Driving needs to significantly reduce and for many adolescents, this may be hard.  If parents teach their kids from an early age not to be centered with the idea of owning a motor vehicle then society can learn to live with fewer cars.

<p>
Ignoring the worlds reliance on fossil fuels is like ignoring the “gorilla in the room,” as Ken explains. Individual changes to lifestyle is not enough to combat climate change if we keep burning fossil fuels like how we are now. However, the change in lifestyle through personal action and political activism is what will ignite the fire of change throughout the government, and the world. Politicians will have a hard time getting elected if they are ignoring other people’s demands. If we demand that something be done about the way we are treating the planet, someone will listen, and hopefully push for change. 
<br><br>

Additionally, the world is not set up for e-biking, which is so sad. We need to become activists and push for safer and easily accessible bike lanes. When my home town painted the bike lanes neon green, I was very confused as to what the purpose of the change was. Now, I see the importance of noticeable, usable, and safe bike lanes. The United States and other such countries need to emulate Copenhagen, a very biker friendly place where 62 percent of people bike to work. Car free Sundays are a great start to shift to a more biking friendly area, while pushing away car use. Copenhagen achieved change through activists forcing city politics to act. 
<br><br>

Personal action and political activism are very important because these are the first steps to starting a movement. People see when others change their ways of life, and when activists urge politicians to support things, people catch on. We will not solve the climate crisis unless we all commit to personal change and action, but not because there will be a large environmental difference. We must end fracking. Not only CO2, but methane too comes from it. This will come through gradual movements and protests of the public. Overall, we must vote. This is the easiest and arguably the most meaningful action you can take to help the environment and say what you believe in.

I completely agree with this comment. I feel like personal action and lifestyle changes are extremely important to this issue and I think it is important to remember that we are actually making a difference on our own, no matter how irrelevant it may seem at times. However I also know that it will take a lot more than just personal action in such a huge worldwide issue. This is why we need to put more energy into political activism. I think that Copenhagen is an inspiring example of how political activism can make a huge difference. If we were able to make similar changes in America, such as creating a more bike-friendly environment and improving our public transportation system, that would go such a long way. I think that these changes are definitely feasible if we would just show our politicians how important they are to us. It is changes like these that seem so easy to obtain, but take lifetimes to achieve because nobody is willing to fight for them.

I definitely agree with Ken on the point that personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active are all intertwined and important.  When you make decisions it often encompasses two or all of the categories as individual actions have wider implications that many may think.
<br><br>

I also believe that it is important, and vital when mitigating the climate crisis, to take part in each of the categories of actions as they can cause widespread change and even the smallest of actions can contribute to the whole big picture change.
<br><br>

Another point I’d like to make is that when it comes to each of them, it is important for everyone to take part in them.  With this collective action, changes can be made quicker and larger than the actions of individuals separately.  In this, you must take a holistic approach as individual's actions in different sectors of climate change solutions are important.  Sometimes, people are only able to make certain changes or participate in certain organizations that combat climate change, and that is ok, that is how it is because trying to take part in everything can be overwhelming and may cause people to burnout.  Therefore, everyone doing what they can is important because as their actions are combined with others, making a difference, it is able to encompass the whole climate crisis problem and fulfill the roles necessary in combating climate change.
<br><br>

In my life, since coming to UCSB, being in Ken’s English 22 and now English 23, I have become much more aware of the climate crisis and what I can do to make a difference.  As such, I have taken part in personal action, climate activism (small scale), and look forward to becoming politically active this election year.  In terms of personal action, I pretty much solely walk, bike, and use public transportation when traveling, I have become vegetarian, and shop more sustainably on the occasions when I do shop.  As for climate activism, what I have done has been pretty small scale in that I have talked to different people about the issue of the climate crisis, just opening up a discussion on it and offering what I have learned to help educate others.  This election year, I look forward to voting for candidates who have climate crisis policies that I can stand behind for creating the vital change on local, state, and federal levels.  Overall, in doing all of this I am simply trying to do what I can to help with the time and resources I have.  I look forward to continuing for years to come.

I would totally agree with you that it is important for everybody to take part in being politically active. Like you said, if you take a holistic approach, you begin to see the power that numbers can have. On the other hand, if you think of your vote as 'only one vote', then you underestimate the power that you can have. I feel that this is one of the largest issues with political idleness. People don't vote because they don't think they can make a change. However, the truth is, if we all vote and we vote in favor of candidates who will address climate issues, then change will start to follow.

I actually started drawing comparisons between e-bikes and e-scooters. Pedestrians hate them. Drivers hate them even more because they are unpredictable. I remember driving down Hollister Avenue, seeing a faint light in front of me. I realized it was an e-scooter in the middle of the road at night. If I didn’t see that faint reflection, who knew what the end result would be. I was shocked that the person would even be on the road that late, that dark at night. I wonder about the liabilities of these e-scooter companies. I’ve read about incidents where people couldn’t control their device and end up giving up their lives on the roads. The first time I used a LIME e-scooter, I thought I was going to be thrown off of that little green scooter within seconds. When I sped up, the piece of metal was so light, my whole body was being dragged by inertia. It was the weirdest feeling ever. No wonder why safe users would wear helmets. Am I ever going to wear a helmet… haha probably not. Look at all the cyclists on campus. You will probably only see 1 in 50 of them will put on a helmet even though my first bike had a huge sticker on it warning the potential of not wearing a helmet. To become an e-bike user, I think it’s so important to check off all the precautionary measures before you head on the road. If you decide to ride at night, you have to make sure your device has reflective lights and avoid sharing the road with automobiles if you can, even if it means you have to take the long way. Drivers being able to turn on red is also very dangerous to not only pedestrians but also bikers that possess a higher speed than people walking. It’s crucial to have a safer infrastructure where biking can be promoted without negative consequences.

One of the things that scares me the most about this video is that many people already choose not to make personal life changes that will aid in combatting the growing climate crisis. From eating less meat to choosing to vote for a green-friendly candidate, there is a great percent of the population that refuses to take part in the necessary reform that our future depends on. I understand the hesitation behind giving up luxuries of today like our cars and dietary habits, but when it comes to things like voter turnout and switching to eco-friendly fuel sources seems like it should be a lot easier given that people aren’t losing anything other than perhaps a couple hours spent casting a vote. Voting is one of the most important forms of climate activism because elected officials are the people who hold the most power in dismantling the climate crushing culture we live in today.

One reason i find the climate crisis issue so complex is because to address many of the major contributors, they must be addressed from the efforts of a group of people rather than under an individual. That is not to say individuals should not modify their behaviors having the mentality that it would have no effect but rather is better understood in the context of Ken’s example on fracking. As an individual it would be extremely difficult to evade the products associated with fracking however as a voting body of people, our political power can be used to nominate candidates who will instill policies that address fracking. While this may the first step, it does need to go further than this as Ken touches on by ensuring that the candidates carry out the commitments they initially made. 

<br><br>

           I also firmly believe in leading by example. If an individual chooses to undertake certain measures to mitigate their carbon footprint or alters certain behaviors, then other people see this and often times follow in example. Changing individual actions and remaining unwavering in them not only shows people how seriously you take the issue but sparks a conversation as to your motivations behind them. Additionally people are more willing to listen to someone whose actions align with their beliefs therefore inspiring others to join your cause. 
<br><br>
On the subject of infrastructure, I strongly support an investment in instilling infrastructure such as bikes lanes which create a built environment that is still environmentally conscious. I also found it interesting that the bike infrastructure began with activists who advocates on a local level. Typically, I view the issue from being solved from the top up but the success in Denmark proves that change from the bottom up is possible.

Just this weekend, I went back on a lot of promises I made to myself and to the planet. I had previously promised to lessen my beef consumption, and here I’ve been doing great but back home my stubborn boyfriend easily convinced me to eat a burger. I immediately felt guilty. I agree with the phrase that transportation is the 800 pound gorilla in the room, and I know how terrible driving a car is for the planet, but as someone who lives in LA, there are no other options. I drove my dad around for about two hours because I’m practicing for my driving test, imagine how much CO2 I released just by practicing. And after I get my license, how much CO2 will I release until mass transportation becomes accessible and efficient? I always say every little change matters, and I still believe so, but it is so easy to grow frustrated especially when everyone around me is saying how trivial my lifestyle changes are. 
<br><br>

I know voting is the number one solution we can make to save the planet, and a college campus is an especially encouraging environment to register to vote and actually go out and vote. Thankfully the green new deal exists, and we must vote for representatives who support it. On campus I use a bike everywhere I go, and I take the bus downtown. A hybrid bike sounds like a great solution to get to work, when you live so close. I couldn’t help but think of my dad, who paints houses and so he drives a lot, and I mean a lot all day. Not only does he drive long distances, but he has to carry his large equipment and materials. There is no way he can ride a bike to work, and even with efficient trains or buses, there is no way he can get around with his materials. Thus, I feel guilty supporting a carbon tax when I imagine it affecting my family, but I feel guilty not supporting it because the earth is dying, and thus I am in a cycle of constant despair.

I understand the double bind you’re in. My dad works downtown about 20 miles from my house, and even with an electric bike, the way there is just not made for cyclists. He could take the train, but it doesn’t even run past about 6pm, and he almost always has to stay at work until 9. He does have a hybrid car and carpools every now and then if he can, but I know it is still not ideal for the planet. I think it is important to remember that a heavy carbon tax is not the only way that voting can help the environment. At the local level, like Ken said, we can promote infrastructure that fosters a bike culture and make public transportation more accessible and practical, these things would not affect people like your dad, and maybe mine would finally be able to take the train to work. We can also vote against new parking lots being built, to make driving everywhere more of a pain, and call for more things like carpool lanes and toll roads. It will be nearly impossible to stop driving all together, but there are plenty of ways (besides a carbon tax) that would make it more difficult to do without thinking. I know if my hometown had limited parking and buses/trains that came more often and later, I would have been doing a lot more to avoid driving.
<br><hr>
I understand your dilemma about supporting this when you know the repercussions that everyone will face as a result. My dad also used to travel long distances by plane every Monday and then back on Friday. He was in a different state every week, therefore, making it impossible to move somewhere closer to avoid the constant flights. I think of him and some of his coworkers who were just doing a job that could be severely impacted by radical change. I wholeheartedly agree that something needs to be done, but we need a whole plan for everyone who will be affected by this in order to get the most people behind this plan. 
<br><br>

Trivial lifestyle changes do make a difference. They may not make as big of a difference as we need, but every little bit helps, especially considering that we are a divided nation and not sure if the Green New Deal will even be implemented. We aren't even sure that any climate change solutions will be implemented at any level after this next election. The least that we can do is to continue to make these trivial changes and vote.


<br><hr>
I really resonated with your comment because I’ve actually had the opposite experience relating to my personal attempt to eat healthier. I live in the Bay Area and my family is very much whole-foods dependent. My family really enjoys eating fresh/healthy food so, when I lived at home, I would eat little to no meat, unless we went out for dinner. I took this all for granted because, the moment I began living in a dorm at UCSB, I just started eating whatever is being served in the dining halls and, in DLG and Ortega, many of the “main dishes” are some sort of meat with perhaps a side of mashed potatoes or something similar. Not really healthy at all. 
<br><br>

Although it has been very difficult for me to try and eat healthier at UCSB,, I don’t have a car and I also use the bus to go to downtown santa barbara, which is lessening my carbon emissions and is making me feel a bit better about my situation. For Americans, transportation really is the “800-pound gorilla in the room” and it is going to be really hard to convince people to stop driving cars (unless, of course, we have such an extensive carbon tax that it would be extremely expensive to drive a car anywhere). But I honestly believe that we, as citizens of America, should act as activists and, as Ken states in this video, and that, first and foremost, we should vote because this is our right that our past generations have fought hard for.

<br><hr>

Yes I do feel as I will screw over my family by supporting things like a carbon tax, but it is necessary that everyone makes changes to help save the planet. There must be some way to ensure everyone lives comfortably and can adjust to the future, but in the first few years of the green new deal it will be difficult on all Americans. I stand by the idea that trivial changes do make a difference, but I agree we must make an even bigger difference, which will only be achieved through the next election.

What's the phrase? Oh, yeah:

<br><br>

Educate. Organize. Agitate.

<br><br>

This isn't a fresh idea, but it's effective. Personal action (let's put that after "educate") is a good first step. It's a comfortable place to be, once you adjust. There are people who have been vegan for decades, only shop second hand for everything, who never fly (99% of our species), who bike to work and school (hi, Ken! And hello to my fellow UCSB students!). These actions become habits, and habits are easy to have. Fighting the climate crisis, however, needs more than our comfortable habits.
<br><br>


Activism can be benign: even something as simple as a clothing swap or vegan potluck would count here, I would argue. But the best kind of activism does agitate; while I hesitate to hijack the work of others and compare other injustices to the climate crisis, movements like feminism in the early 1900s and the civil rights movement in the 60s were effective because activists were loud, unrelenting, and inconvenienced those in power. Now, Greta Thunberg is garnering international attention because she agitates, and she does it well.  If we want lasting and effective change to take place, we need to do more than just take personal action. We need to find issues we are passionate about, as individuals, and zero in to make change. Not a single person can do it all; even the most eco-friendly among us have pitfalls. But a group of individuals dedicated to stirring up the government to get results can do it all; in the words of Margaret Mead, that's the only thing that has ever induced change.

<br><br>

What I'm taking away from this video, and more broadly this class, is that I can't get bogged down by the enormousness of the issue. The climate crisis is real, it is harming people now, today, and it will harm many more people in the coming years, even if we changed our ways today. Our society needs a complete overhaul socially, politically, and economically if we even want to entertain the idea of solving the climate crisis. It's an enormous, daunting undertaking, and everyone has to do their part. But none of us has to do it alone, and that simple reason is why we are going to be able to change the things we need to in order to save ourselves.

I really liked your comment. This really sums up the main points in the argument, and I love the use of the word  "agitate." I think it is a perfect word to use for what needs to be done in order to gain the attention needed to address the issue of climate change. We need to step out of our comfort zone when being an activist for the climate; be annoying! be loud! People need to hear what we have to say, and this is how we're going to get them to.
<br><br>

Even if we are practicing environmentally friendly habits (public transport, veganism, thrifting, etc) if we aren't getting others to do the same, what impact do we really have? It worked with veganism. The "in your face everywhere you turn in the grocery store" tactic. And we saw results. Being vegan was deemed annoying at first, then with persistence, it became a trend. This won't be done with other actions unless we get out there with our messages. Ken is right. Personal action, climate action, and being politically active are all equally important. We need to be moving towards a plant based diet while also going out and voting in local elections. Eat your veggie burger as you sign the ballots! We also need to work together, to unite.  There is too much division around climate change, and it needs to be resolved. We have to share information regarding out changing climate, and be transparent about it. Remove the politics from the problem and face it together. Alone, we will not win against the ever worsening climate crisis.

In this lecture Ken says that we need to vote for climate activists. That we need to vote for climate change policies in order to help our planet. The sad thing about this is that even though we vote for people who are climate change activists in our eyes may not help our planet because they might just want to use our vote to get themselves into office. Many people in this country take advantage of others' trust so they can get more power and sadly this happens a lot in our government. Sometimes politicians say that they are going to implement a certain policy so they get the public's vote. Ken also mentions that we need to vote on policies that will help our planet but the problem with that is even though we vote for the policy it doesn’t mean that it is going to get passed. For example he says that a policy we could vote on is the Green New Deal but that policy is being debated between the democratic and republican party. I guess we have to take our chances and do the best we can and leave it to the government. 
<br><br>

 I have noticed that many of the people in our power are older who don’t really have a proggressive mind and think pretty old school and that is a problem that we need to fix because we need to live in the present and future. We need to start getting younger people in power.

I agree with the many ways of making contributions to fight against climate change. There is the idea that we need to vote and call for legislation to take actions such as ending fracking. We need to vote for candidates that advocate for policies such as carbon pricing and the green new deal. We can also change our mode of transportation. It is impressive to learn that 62% of the people in Copenhagen commute by bike. This makes me think of the fact that a lot of the people in large Chinese cities commute by bus, metro, or bikes. Because there is heavy traffic during rush hours, some large cities even restrict cars on the road based on the last digit of their license plate number and the day of the week. Though I don’t think this can be applicable to US cities, such phenomenon of people using transportation that has a low carbon footprint makes the point that perhaps it is not that difficult to switch one’s way of transportation.

One thing that I think is really important that Ken touched on was the fact that it only takes a few hours to vote and help make a change that could make a life long change. I do believe that it's not just being politically active that will help make an impact and with that said, I don't think that either of the 3 options; personal action, climate activism or being politically active is useful solely on its own. I think that climate activism is huge and can make a change if you don't support what you preach with your own personal actions, you aren't reaching your full potential. if we don't vote and try to push things through congress there is no way to put any movement into action. So overall its a combination of all three that will help benefit the environment in the best way. 

<br><br>

In terms of making changes on a local level, I do think that it's one of the first major steps that we can take in fully changing the trajectory of our atmosphere. If we don't look at what is happening in each city and make examples out of the change that is possible, fixing our carbon emissions for the whole planet, won't go very smooth. We have to start at the local level in order to build our way up. If we can prove that something works with actual evidence we will have a better chance at creating a good plan for our entire planet.

I think that this is a great comment. It addressed all the topics I wanted to  and it put them together better than I could have. Voting is a very easy way to help out and it takes very little time to accomplish. People really need to see the value of voting because it really does have a lasting impact on not only us but everyone. Personal action is also very important as it shows others they can do it as well as really making you feel like you are making a change. And climate activism is also quite big as it is groups of people they can really make a difference, no one person can do it by themselves. Yet, the effectiveness of these three aspects alone are not as powerful as they are collectively. Together these three actions can really make a difference, while individually they can only do so much and they have a limit. So I agree, all three together is the best way to do it. I also really like the point that you made on the local level about showing that it can work on a small scale and then applying that to a larger scale. If local governments can set the standard for the federal government that would be fantastic. The local government can try something and if it doesn’t work no harm is done, but if it does work than applying it to the federal government could make a significant difference. So with that being said we should take Copenhagen as an example of a small scale working and trying to apply it to a larger scale. I know that not everything can work in a federal government that can work in a local government, but some stuff can be adapted to and it could really help. So yes, local government may be the first major step in order to change the federal government.

I also agree with the comment above and also think that it is really important that Ken mentioned that it only takes a few hours to vote and help make a change that can make the impact of a lifetime. Voting is a simple but efficient type of action that can help make great impacts. We can use voting as a way to push our beliefs whether it be on climate change or really anything, to people who can implement policies that will hopefully satisfy our beliefs and help make a change. Ken mentions that state, city, and local elections all make huge impacts, and we can support local policies that have effects on us. This is what is going to help save our planet, actions that involve gathering a group collectively are going to have a greater impact on the world rather than taking personal action such as going vegan, although that is still a very small step in the right direction. These personal actions are too small, that they will not impact our world enough to really make a difference in defeating the climate crisis. However, I feel that more people need to first become more aware of the climate crisis problem and be educated on it, in order to want to bring awareness and form groups to bring that awareness to politicians, urging them to make such policies. Without this, I think our society is just going to continue with their lives and remain oblivious to the current destruction going on in our world.

Personally, I am not much of a guy who participates in activist events of any kind. I prefer to make changes through my actions of voting, boycotting, and telling people the truth organically than in public displays. I hate when people shove things in my face that I already know, so my form of "activism" is to just tell people the truth when they say something that they are clearly misinformed by. This will be the first election I will actually be able to vote in, so I am excited to make a difference in that way. I agree that the best thing we can do is vote. 
<br><br>


Yes, I can switch to a plant-based diet. However, if it's just me making that change, cows are still going to be bred and the meat industry will still prosper. Even with the constant news coming out that smoking cigarettes is terrible for your health, about ten to fifteen percent of Americans still smoke. Now, if we can cut down on everyone eating meat just like we cut down on everyone smoking, it would definitely help. However, that 10-15% of the population that stays strong in their ways will still kill the environment. As long as there is a market for beef products it will be a problem. The more I think about this, the more doomed I see we are...

<p>
It is sad to hear Ken said that it is not even nearly enough even though we change into a plant-based diet, drive less, and fly less. The unfortunate fact is that people willing to take these actions only take a relatively small part of the whole population. Still, more people are not likely to take personal actions voluntarily to mitigate the climate crisis. However, it should not be an excuse that “I should give up because more people are not taking action.” Imagine that if we, the students who know the truth, give up, are there any other people willing to make some efforts?

Regarding the bicycle lanes, it is kind of dangerous to take a bike in many places around the US. In China, bicycle lanes are available in most places. Moreover, there are guardrails to separate the bike lane from the car lane, so it is safe to take bikes in most cities, even in some busy streets. In my hometown, many people prefer to take bikes to commute. However, it is usually rainy there, which is one of the facts that may discourage people to take bicycles. This is also what I feel strange. There are almost no rainy days in California, which is an excellent condition for cyclists. However, it seems that not many people choose to ride a bicycle, and the government has not built some dedicated bicycle lanes. There are more than 5 car lanes on some American roads, but there is no place for bicycles. It makes me wonder why the government or the public is so indifferent to bike and bicycle lanes. Just as Ken mentioned in the videos, taking bikes can bring people many benefits–keeping healthy, no traffic jams, etc. In the meantime, carbon footprint can be cut, which is also a benefit for the whole society.

I completely agree with you. It is crazy to think that even if everyone switched to a completely plant-based diet, drive less and fly less it would still be not enough to fix the climate crisis on our planet. The saddest part for me is that we still are so far away from even getting people to take on these challenges of changing to a plant-based diet and driving less. I mean our class for example, even with all this information of how much a detrimental affect eating meat has on the environment, yet still more than half of the students eat an omnivores diet. If we can’t even get the people who know the a lot about the detriment of the world how are we going ot get the people who deny climate change to take action. 
      <br><br>
      On the contrary, after having these negative thoughts Kens example of how Copenhagen rose up and insisted on getting better bike paths really inspired me that we can make a change. I think the biking example goes for most things. If we are able to get the people behind it then we can make a change. The people have the voice, and in a true democratic society this is how action takes place. 
<br><br>
            As you said it is hard to ensure bicycle safety in huge cities and places where people are to familiar with riding bike, but that doesn’t mean that action cannot be taken place. The weather also makes it hard for bikes, but what I have learned is that we can adapt and learn how to be comfortable in the unknown. Once someone become familiar and comfortable with biking in the rain, they will not second guess it, and may end up enjoying the process. 
<br><br>
            I think rising up and demanding for what is right is the next step that we need to take. We need to develop a new normal. We need a clean slate where everyone can come together and define a new normal that is good for the environment. Humans are creatures of habit, if we are able to clean state then we can make new better habits.


<br><hr>

I agree with a lot of the points that you made throughout your comment and you came up with some interesting outlooks that I had failed to consider before. I believe that if more people were willing to give up their cars and start biking from place to place, then there would be more motive to start spending tax money on bike lines and improving them so that they are safer for bikers, and less money on repairing the roads for cars. I can see how biking in large cities would be dangerous with how many cars there are and how unprotected the bike lines are from the actual road.This small step of repairing the bike lanes, and a boost in the number of bikers would lead to a reduction in the carbon emissions. If frequent flyers were to find a new way to get to their destination that would reduce carbon emissions significantly because there is only 1% of the population that actually fly. If they were to personally change their mode of transportation, there would be less carbon emissions put into the atmosphere by planes.

Every little action, no matter how big or small, can benefit the environment. From personal action, to climate activism, to becoming politically active. Anything that anyone can do is a positive step in the right direction. But all three have their greater advantages, for example personal action is more personal, it's in the name, and makes one feel like they have control over the environment, from cutting out on meat, to taking public transportation, to deciding not to fly, it all matters. As for climate activism and becoming politically active gives one a greater voice, and gets one's voice heard. All of these things are needed when trying to combat the climate crisis, and not one is better than the other. As a society we cannot get mad at someone for not doing more, but encourage them to do more and celebrate the little one is doing for the environment, even if it's just not eating meat on the weekends. Every step is a step regardless of how big or small it is.

Yes, as Ken mentioned in the lecture, personal actions and political impact are closely interconnected. In the lecture, Ken has advocated us all to vote for those politicians who stand for protecting our planet, and also enact small actions on our own. I has a similar personal experience as Ken noticed in his time. Between the choice of owning a car and a bike in UCSB campus, I’d rather choose to have a bike with me every day, not necessarily because it will largely reduce my personal carbon footprint, but because it brings so much convenience to my daily life. Taking my bike from IV Theater and go all the way to Campbell hall only takes five minutes, and it makes me able to be on time every time when there is only 10 minutes break between two lectures. Yet, if I have a car, it takes me over ten minutes for only finding a parking lot near Campbell Hall. Yet, it is not as easy to popularize bikes to all populations as we can easily realize how convenient bikes are. Nowadays, possessing a car becomes a sign of becoming more popular among students. More and more students tend to buy cars to show they have more privileges than others. So it is generally very hard to convince people to do something good to the environment by giving up their own goods. Besides, when the good personal action is politically connected and operated, people tend to become indifferent towards the issue since they think the politicians have already turned the climate change issue into a complete political battle. That’s really annoying and makes it even harder for all people to come together to protect our planet.

I agree with Professor Hiltner that personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active work hand in hand to fight climate change. There is not one sole thing that will eradicate CO2 emissions but there is a plethora of changes and approaches we can take on an individual and global level to reduce CO2 emissions. I believe that change starts with one person. That one person has the power to change their decisions and lifestyle to benefit the planet as well as continue its longevity for the generations to come. That one person also has the power to vote and when the masses chose to prioritize the climate over selfish needs we can see change within our government. It’s extremely important to note that change doesn’t always need to be on a global level, it can be on a local one. For example, Copenhagen is a perfect example of people changing their lifestyles and getting their local representatives to back their climate conscious choices to provide bike users with safer routes and lanes. Currently, ⅔ of  Copenhagen’s population commutes using bikes or public transportation. This just goes to show that personal lifestyle changes and climate activism with the aid of politics can go a long way fighting the climate crisis.

I grew up in a very contrasting household when it came to politics. One on hand my mom didn't really like politics because they always made her mad and the older she got the busier she got which also meant that it was harder for her to go out and vote for the things and people she did stand for. My aunt on the other hand is probably the most involved person I know. Ever since I was little she would always tell me how important it was to go out and vote and be an active political member in our society if I ever wanted to see change take place. As I got older, I fairly understood both of their points; I learned why being so active in politics was important and what I could do to help when I was old enough, but I also agreed with my mom on how angry I could feel over it and noticed how increasingly difficult making time to go out and vote as actually become.  All this to say, I think all personal action, climate activism, and political activism are equally important matters. To me, they all intertwine so it would make sense for all of them to be held in the same standard. Political activism is the ultimate goal. The only way we can see change in our government is if we vote for it. The only way that more politicians will see how important this issue is, is if we go out and actively vote for it. Political activism would however require climate activism. If we did not fight to be heard about the pressuring issues that the globe is currently facing because of the climate crisis, then there would be no need to fight for it within the government.  On the same note, It would be quite difficult to partake in climate activism if we were not taking personal actions to hold ourselves accountable for the very things we believe in; in a way it would be similar to a person claiming to be vegetarian or vegan and then proceeding to eat a double double from in-n-out. I like to think of this domino effect as the perfect combination between my mother and my aunt. We should fight, hard and loud in every aspect possible. We vote, we act, and we don't give up on our stances even if the odds are not our side. But, we also start with ourselves, we start to be about our business rather than just talking about how everyone else has the power to fix it. Plus, (as my mom would enjoy) we can do it on our terms, in our own way, in some areas - in the respect of our own home.

As an international student, I grew up in a country where people cannot affect government decisions. But just like you say that all personal action, climate activism, and political activism are equally important matters. In the process of reading the green New Deal, I thought the green New Deal sounded good at first, but after thinking about it, I thought it was an unfeasible policy. It is hard not to believe that the Green New Deal has a perfect, realistic, and enforceable plan that will work. At the same time, when I compare it to current consumerism and materialism in the United States, I find it hard to believe the plan will work. Without some kind of push or incentive, it is impossible for every American to follow the guidelines laid down in the green New Deal, and that is what the Green New Deal is all about. At that time, I think policies cannot solve problems. However, what we can do is start making changes around us. Of course, personally, action may be effective to protect the environment. If people try to use more public transportation, it will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide leasing from cars a lot.

Ken points out that we need to make efforts to mitigate the climate crisis both from a personal approach and a collective approach. He underscores it is not enough if people just take personal approach. Collective approach is indispensable. For example, foregoing cars and airplanes can reduce a lot of CO2 footprint. However, going vegan and foregoing cars from a personal approach can not reduce a lot of other greenhouse gas---methane. Fracking and the beef industry are two major sources of methane, and only a few people choose to go vegan do not influence the production of the beef. Furthermore, there are many people will not choose to go vegan voluntarily. Hence, environmental activists play an important role in combating the climate crisis by voting. They can vote for the politicians who manage to counteract climate change. Ken mentions Copenhagen as an example to illustrate that bike environmental activists reduce the usage of cars in Copenhagen by voting. 
 <br><br>
    Ken also notes that personal approach is also necessary. He highlights that he commutes between his office and his home by using his e-bike. The time that he spends on riding a bike is as same as the time he spends on driving a car. Since it takes lots of time to find a parking spot and walk to the lecture hall. However, the infrastructure of the bike lane in Santa Barbara is not good, and lots of casualties happened in the past decades. Thus, the infrastructure should be improved, and activists can vote for a politician who is willing to fund on improving the infrastructure.

I believe all of them are important. But if you say we have to give them an order, I will say personal action is the first and climate activism and becoming politically active are the second. The reason why I give this order is that I believe if you want to change others, you have to change yourself first. After you change yourself then you can use yourself as a successful example to convince others to change also.  So the first step to making a difference in climate change is a personal action. We have to have personal action first then climate activism and becoming politically active. If we can even move the first step, personal action, we don't have the persuasiveness to do other steps.

I definitely agree with you on how you order the different ways to take action against the climate crisis. Personal action can help people get their ideas and opinions in order while giving them something to do outside of climate activism and voting. Also, being personally active gives a person some sort of credibility when trying to fight for a more climate conscious change among the world. Personal action can also lead to someone doing more research into how they can be active in the other two ways. I remember hearing someone in one of my classes saying “I didn’t vote in the primary because I didn’t know enough to know who to vote for.” This is where all three types of action can combine. Changing your lifestyle can lead to educating yourself, leading to a more stable stance in politics and gaining information on how to be active on a larger scale.

Many people from business owners to politicians make the statement that renewable energy and emission free ways of producing energy will cost too much money that would be needed in other areas. However, we are already spending billions to protect cities from rising sea levels and rebuilding cities after record fires or hurricanes. We are spending all this money trying to repair something we continue to cause rather than spending money to stop these events from happening. Building wind turbines might be expensive but once own is built it produces unlimited free energy, which is much less expensive than rebuilding entire cities due to consequences of the climate crisis. For decades now people have known about the climate crisis, however it probably seemed abstract to most people, the consequences of the previous generations’ pollution did not directly affect them for many decades until now. However, we are now starting to realize that the consequences are appearing faster and more dangerous than people predicted decades ago. A few decades ago, the main worries of global warming was going to be sea level rise, however, every single place in the world is starting to feel the effects of climate change. Even in Santa Barbara we are feeling the effects of bigger, and more dangerous fires every year. Still many people are unwilling to change their lifestyle even in small ways such as adjusting their diets or buying less clothing items every year. Steps like Copenhagen took to make their city bike friendly are necessary to control the climate crisis.

In the lecture, Ken pointed out that by simply changing personal decisions or lifestyle are far not enough to effectively help with the CO2 emission problem. He also claims that even all people become vegan, the changes will not even reach the level of fracking. So, there are far more works to do to protect our environment. And one of the actions we can take to help is to end fracking which is the one of the main causes of CO2 emission by voting. To vote to pass the policy of ending fracking and make it public. Although, i cannot vote, since i am an international student, i can encourage my fiends who are eligible to vote. In addition, choosing which transportation to take is an important and easiest parts that we can do to contribute to the protection of environment. We should choose to take the transportation which would not emit much CO2 like bike or public transportation. As for me, i don’t own a bike. And i will not consider buying a car these years as it’s not only unnecessary but also harmful to environment. As a college student, i walk to the classroom everyday. If i need to leave campus, i would take bus, the public transportation.

I couldn't agree more that Voting is the best direction for fighting against the climate change, especially in a nation where the major industries in oil and tobacco reinforce the hardheaded congressmen with bribery and "donations". We as people can only do much to state our opinions through activism in this country and the power of every single one of our votes can voice our opinion in a wider scale. By voting in people who understand our own views and the greater danger of the climate change is posing on our planet, Like Alexandria Ocasio Cortes, we can bring awareness of climate change to the front desk of the congress here in the United States. By by getting younger congressmen into the Congress, it'll begin to shift the balance of climate deniers who are bribed by the higher industries of the United States towards the firm believers and those who understand that we need to change our ways now or else we will fall into a cataclysmic future of ever growing problems where the lowest income families and even countries will suffer admits the suns blaze.
 <br><br>
I personally promote the fact that we should all go out and vote because every single one matters. Also, I'm not saying that activism isn't any less as powerful, it has it's own great use of spreading your message across the populous of the United States, where shifting they're own opinions is what matters later when the voting scene arrives where it matters the most. The problem is that the climate change topic has become a topic of political issues which is the worse thing that could have occurred to it. The fate of the World and the generations after us being fought over two political parties is a joke, how can the fate of our planet and those after us really be a topic of debate?  I find this ridiculous how it could have come to this and the major reason why I'll say it over and over, our votes matter because, we the people, have the power to choose who can lead this country for a better tomorrow. To overthrow the puppets that live in our nations highest position who are controlled by the puppet master called the Oil Industries (Exxon). With the upcoming election in our midst, the time to vote hasn't been more crucial than now, as we must bare up arms and join together for a much more better planet and for a better future, or else we will live in a world, buying Air from Mr O'Hare like this is Dr Seuss's The Lorax.

Climate activism is by far the best thing that you can do for the environment. As Ken said, knowledge is not power. Knowledge is power only if acted upon! This is too true. Becoming politically active could include a wide range of definitions and so does personal action. If one person decreases their carbon footprint to zero, it is less than a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the world. It is true though that one must lead by example, as other people are judging you at all times, whether you like it or not. Climate activism is the true cause, worthy for the real ones out there. Being a true climate activist honestly includes personal action as well as being politically active which is why it simply why it matters the most.

People may hear “personal action” and “climate activism” and “being politically active” and run for the hills, and I get it, those are some scary words all bunched together. However, when you think about the amount of time and effort it would take you to do these 3 things in comparison with the impact that they could have, they sound like a piece of cake! Voting (being more politically active) takes literally less than an hour a year, changing eating/transportation habits (personal action) won’t cost you much and doesn’t add that much time to your daily schedule, and showing up to a rally or calling your representatives (climate activism) is not only fun and empowering, but requires less effort than ordering a pizza from your smartphone. In the grand scheme of things, I would much rather skip that trip to McDonald’s or take the train than die of heat related death in the next couple decades. 
 <br><br>
Now that I am equipped with all of the right tools to try to make changes for the sake of our environment (thank you Ken), I think the next best course of action would be to educate the people around me about how easy and fulfilling it can be to try to live a more green lifestyle. All of this information has been so helpful and has really allowed me to start to become the climate activist I wish to be, and I think it would be selfish to not share it with other young people passionate about the planet.

I agree with you and think that making all three of these changes does not require much effort at all. I also think that the more people that become politically active and change their habits, the more others will see that these things are achievable and even desirable. I think that in order for things to change society needs to integrate all three things, changing personal habits, voting, and activism. We need to not only preach what we want, but practice it too. While small changes in the lives of people may not have that big of a climate impact in terms of C02 reduction, it can have a big social impact as more and more people become educated. We also need to think bigger than just personal actions and be activists, demanding bigger changes for the good of the many. Education is so important and the more people that learn about the problems we are facing and how beneficial the solutions will be, the more we can use our power as citizens to demand sustainability.


<br><hr>
I agree with your first sentence because people are not willing to do these voluntarily. Ken's explanation of voting and how he first started by saying how it only takes an hour a year was very intriguing and made me proud knowing that I will be participating in the upcoming elections. Personal actions are small and might not make the biggest difference, but it is still important to consider. When you mentioned how we need to educate those around us, I definitely agree. I also think it needs to be taken seriously. After taking this class, I have been trying to talk to my friends and mentioning things I have learned. But to the media or some other people, it is seen as a joke. "The world is ending". It just makes it so difficult to be taken seriously when trying to educate those around us. Everyone needs a wake-up call to realize what is happening and that we need to actually do something. This is not like media stories that go away after a while. Our climate crisis is happening now and is not going to stop unless we take the necessary action. I truly hope the climate crisis gets the attention and seriousness that it requires.

First off, in response to the "Dear Government Brown" portion of the lecture, I found it ironic that brown denied to ban fracking despite his commitment to migrating the climate crisis. I had to replay that part so many times because I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
 <br><br>

Moving on, despite knowing how important voting is, this lecture has reinforced my knowledge on the importance of voting. Especially since it only takes about 1-2 hours a year. This is notably one of the most efficient ways to combat climate change that doesn't take a lot of effort. So VOTE!
 <br><br>

On to the topic of transportation and transitioning to a cleaner, greener form of transportation. This topic always makes me feel so defeated because of how integrated mainstream transportation is. Cars are convenient for obvious reasons, but it's extremely saddening to see and hear how "the world isn't set up for bike riders" like Ken mentioned. I remembered how amazed I was when I first came to UCSB. Seeing the rows upon rows of bikes and the plethora of bike lanes was something I had never seen before. Comparing it to my hometown, UCSB was bike paradise, with "bikers having the right of way". Back where I'm from, little to none of the people in my city really rode bikes as there weren't any truly safe bike lanes.
 <br><br>

Overall, although this lecture covered topics we have already been through, I appreciated how Ken was able to take on a different perspective and bring up new points that I haven't considered.

I completely agree with your comment. It's incredibly important to vote. Many people around the world do not have the privilege of voting. Whether it's because of gender, religion or property rights, there are billions around the world who simply go unheard. If we don't use our privilege to make positive change then what is the point of having it?

 <br><br>

In my hometown, most people drive around even though I come from a relatively small town where biking would be adequate to ride around. Nevertheless, the bike lanes are completely unsafe, and I think most people would be embarrassed to ride around in a bike and be seen by someone they know. I think transportation may be one of the most challenging things to overhaul, but I think it would be beneficial for everyone. Although it may feel inconvenient at first, being in a car stuck in traffic isn't fun at all. Riding a bicycle and taking the bus are much less stressful than driving, and much safer. 
 <br><br>


It's comforting knowing that the best thing we can do for our environment is vote. It can feel overwhelming, feeling like you have to go vegan, completely change your transportation methods,   and buy much less things. Although doing these things are still extremely important, they take a lot of energy and time. Voting is much easier and much less time consuming, but still just as important.

This lecture just reminded me to review my sample ballot and research the candidates and measures that I am going to be voting on. The March 3rd primary is coming up and those we can vote have to be well informed and step out to actually vote. The turnout for voters between the ages of 18-29 was 36% during the 2018 midterm elections. Although that was a large increase from the previous election cycle, it is still far too small. There needs to be a greater turnout in young voters. The only way I can see that happening is by creating a national holiday for elections in order for people to actually go out and vote because many are not able to go out and vote because they have school or work and they are not allowed to take time out of their day in order to go vote. In order to truly make changes that we feel will be impactful we must go out and vote for candidates and measures that work to reduce our impact on the climate crisis.

I agreed with a lot of what you said in your comment. For one, I was completely appalled by Brown refusing to cut fracking in California. Brown has pledged to help the environment, he is committed to climate change, this is so ironic. I can only see on way for this to be explained. Fossil fuel interests probably convinced him or his colleagues to keep fracking around. I am also of the group that believes voting activism is the best thing you can do. Although personal change is great, it’s not going to do much if we don’t have enough people on the same board. Also, more voting for supports of climate change, the more legislation and change we can have. If all we do is personal change without the activism, we let the 1% thrive while we sacrifice and continue to just watch the planet overheat. In a sense, as Ken mentioned, activism and personal change are linked. People need to see a change to believe it. One can’t ask others to make an effort for the climate if they themselves don’t. Making the visible effort to support our planet in any way is activism. I think something we can all do is talk to our parents about voting. Even if you think your parents are left-leaning, maybe they can extend these thoughts to friends and extended family. We want to convince as many people as we can of the older generation that climate activism is necessary for the future of this planet. For me, this is probably the biggest take from this course. I need the mindset of an activist; I need to try and spread the wisdom of this class to others in a compelling way that promotes change.

I personally love to bike places rather than drive, especially in Santa Barbara where there’s nature and scenery everywhere you go. It wasn’t something I did often in my hometown of Irvine, however, because the city’s infrastructure was very bike-unfriendly and basically necessitated the use of cars. It’s inspiring to hear that more and more cities are building bike-friendly paths and improving their infrastructure to ultimately cut back on carbon emissions. The U.S. should be following in the footsteps of places like Copenhagen, and encouraging people to use their bikes more often. Not only is it good for the environment, but it promotes a healthier lifestyle. For those that are unwilling to make the change to bikes, Ken’s method of using electric bikes is another option to consider as they would travel faster than normal bikes and requiring less pedaling on the individual’s part. Electric scooters are another alternative that are very popular in densely populated areas, like Santa Monica and Santa Barbara. Additionally, we should be fighting to prioritize better public transportation so that people wouldn’t have to rely on fuel-heavy cars to commute to work and school. These are measures that have already been taken in most other developed nations, yet the U.S. is lagging far behind on sustainable and efficient public transport.
 <br><br>
Voting is another important way to support environmentally-friendly policies and politicians who support them. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, are both prominent advocates for the Green New Deal, a set of policies that will put the U.S. more on track to fighting the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
Hi, I agree with your comments. Although Americans rank climate change as a low priority to vote, environmental protection is on the higher end. But, I think people are starting to understand more how our health, economic impacts, the environment, and several other factors can all be interrelated. And as there are more awareness towards global warming now, I think that voters are seeing it as not just a political issue,  but an actual threatening problem. As election season comes up, the warm weather can cast a reminder to all of America of its rising global temperatures so everyone vote!! It only takes a few hours.

<br><hr>
I also remember that this is not the first time Ken mentions about the importance about voting. Although it is important that our little steps such as eating habits, our personal energy consumptions are important, overall speaking the voting is the ultimate and the most importance solution. It is the most practical because it is the most easy way for us to do. Maybe change to bike from your car is a little bit hard for you now, voting is not. Although voting might sounds easy and small but it is the most effective way. I also want to point out that the second part of the video which is about biking is closely related to the first part that is voting. The reason is simple, if we vote enough, the government will listen to our voices and make changes for us based on our own needs. The point of voting is to express our need in order to follow our wishes to make changes. We can gain the lifestyle that we want and we can peach in to make the earth better. I like you use the hours that we can all give 1 to 2 hours a week to make the earth better. It is the simple way for all of us, so make sure we do it.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you and Professor Ken on the importance of voting! Voting is incredibly important especially on the local level because many of the changes we want to see are done by local politicians. A thing that struck to me about this lecture video was that voting isn't enough, which I also definitely agree with. Even though it is highly important to vote, it's also important to hold these politicians accountable. This can be done by taking more of an activist role in order to show politicians that we want actual change and won't let them giving us empty promises. 
 <br><br>

Apart from that, I also agree with you on how the topic of transportation makes you feel defeated. Every time I go home I feel that there has been a new person who has been hit by a car when they were on their bike. Even though laws and regulations have implemented to protect bikers, I feel that there should be more bike infrastructure that would make riding bikes more sustainable. The reason is that laws and regulations could only do so much, but the infrastructure will make it easier for people to choose riding a bike instead.

<br><hr>
I agree, voting is incredibly important. It always irks me when I hear about people not voting, especially when they assume the "my vote doesn't matter" ideology. When you boil down the people who ensure that they vote, you end up with people who are very polarized in their political opinions. People like this often take the side of their preferred political party, on just about every topic. This means that for things like the GND, they side with whatever their "higher-ups" say. This makes a mess of using politics as a way to see improvements in the country, and instead replaces it with a battle of the parties. 
 <br><br>

To mend this, objective people, particularly the youth who likely have had less time to choose a party to glue themselves to, should especially vote as they will be able to view topics objectively, and choose the best candidate, not choose their party.
<br><hr>
Becoming politically active, I believe, is a very important step in solving the issue of climate change. By becoming politically active, we can give everyone a voice and a chance to speak about this climate crisis and we can vote for those who are willing to put themselves out there and support those who have a plan for the crisis that we are in. Voting is something that anybody can do because it is based on how you feel as a person. Transportation-wise, there are many issues that I see with stemming our dependence on the personal car. By switching to a bike, we are able to reduce our carbon emissions significantly and also live a healthier life. It is true that this world isn't set up for bike riders as the main mode of transportation at this moment is the car. The car is a source of convenience that isn't easily replaced, but if we were able to do so, this would be something quite extraordinary that we could do to help support the world and fight the climate crisis.

In all honesty this lecture gave me some mixed messages. The fact that prominent climate change activists and scientists like Naomi Klein say that becoming vegan does not have a big enough impact on the environment goes against what we have been learning in previous lectures, that one of the greatest contributions you can make to the climate crisis involves changing your eating habits. Ken then goes on to explain, however, that if we in America made a similar change in our transportation habits as was made in Copenhagen, we could reduce global carbon emissions by 3.8 billion pounds. To me, these two pieces of information are conflicting, and do not clarify whether individual change will have a significant impact or not. I personally believe that we should each do as much as we can just to show compassion for the Earth and hopefully inspire others to do the same because we are very lucky to have such a beautiful planet. 
 <br><br>

What I do like about this lecture is its emphasis on voting. Political action is so important because it has the power to enact wide-scale changes that are just not possible for individuals to enact alone. I like that Ken is encouraging us to talk to others about the importance of voting. I think this is good advice because most people are rather uneducated on what they are voting for. By just telling your friends about the importance of a certain bill or candidate, you could significantly impact the results of an election in favor of the planet. Overall, I think it is morally right to make personal changes in your life, but the action that will most directly benefit the planet is voting.

I completely agree with your whole statement especially what you said about the importance of voting and how it makes wide-spread change. I too am a bit confused about this specific lecture because the majority of this class has been about how we as individuals can scale back our own personal carbon footprint. Examples of this are even included in this lecture such as biking instead of driving or flying, eating a plant-based diet, or even not buying into fast fashion. So I think what i’m trying to say is that why have we been spending so long on these individual solutions when in reality they can’t do much to help the planet except boost my own environmental ego. I understand that we all need to change our greedy ways in order to live a more sustainable life but I feel like we should’ve spent more time discussing the big changes we can make as a society such as voting. I really enjoyed how Ken made such an emphasis on the importance of voting. While we as individuals apparently can’t do much to help, as a collective group we can make wide sweeping changes such as voting in politicians that will support environmental bills/legislation. I’ve never understood why people don’t vote, saying things like, “my vote doesn’t matter”. This statement extremely frustrates me because being able to vote is a privilege, this will be my first election voting and i’m pretty excited. We need to make our votes count if we want to see change occur and that’s not going to happen if people who are concerned don’t vote.


<br><hr>
I agree with you on the mixed messages. However, I think that it is more clear when you look at it in binary. Alone, individual action is not enough. Neither is systemic change without behavioral changes at the individual level. To truly save humanity, we need both: systemic change at the institutional level but also individual behavioral change. The best way we can blend the two is voting, something that is both an individual behavior, but also something that brings systemic change. 
 <br><br>
The thing that I do find really frustrated is that so many people don't feel any need to act at all because they fall back on the belief that individual actions don't change anything. I think this is a crappy excuse to not engage with new ideas or behavioral changes. This segways in people choosing not to vote because they don't think their individual voice matters. This is the exact opposite, literally every voice matters in local and state elections, and in close presidential elections, they matter as well.



<br><hr>
Likewise I felt that the personal changes got disregarded a bit too much in order to promote political activism. I understand the importance of activism as well as how the oncoming primary election in California further emphasizes that importance. However, pitting these two ideas against each other in the way that Ken does, by discussing what matters more, can make it so individual changes feel less important and make one question why they bother to change for the environment when the majority keeps their fantastical lifestyle. It makes it feel like personal behavior changes and decision making is too minimal in comparison to the importance of political action. That said, I do understand stressing how much voting matters when it comes to how big nations, like the Unites States of America, decide how to confront the climate crisis. It's obvious, just look at the differences between how the Obama administration addressed climate change compared to how the Trump administration addresses it. The current president literally used it at a joke during a rally just because the temperature was a bit too cold. Educating yourself about the political standings on the climate crisis locally and nationally can have a drastic impact on how presidential and local candidates are decided. So while I'm not entirely happy with the format of the video, I appreciate that Ken continues to stress the importance of political activism.

In my opinion, the most important strategy to combating the climate crisis is being politically active. While personal action helps to mitigate the effects of climate change, and climate activism can help increase awareness about environmental issues, both of these things are essentially useless if you can’t put these ideas into concrete actions. That is where being politically active comes into play. Through political action, you are able to make sweeping changes to the current system, like the increased bicycle infrastructure in Denmark, or imposing economic sanctions, like a carbon tax. Even if everyone makes small personal changes in their life, it will not be enough. Instead, we need to focus more energy on changing our entire societal structure: methods of transportation, pollution and emissions, the way we use energy resources, the types of energy we consume, etc. These are things that can only be tackled with action supported by the government. Another example of this would be fracking, which, as Ken discusses, can not be stopped through individual action, only through policy and/or economic sanctions. I agree with Ken’s opinion that the most important thing you can do to protect the climate is to vote. It is so important to back candidates and initiatives that prioritize sustainability, because this is how your opinion is heard by the politicians making decisions. It is of course, important to also engage in personal action and climate activism, seeing as all three strategies work hand-in-hand, but the easiest way to support the environment in your everyday life is to vote.

“Personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active. Which matters more?“
 <br><br>
Personal action such as diet, transportation, lifestyle would not act enough contribution to ease the stress of global warming. Moreover, people will not change their lifestyles just for green house emission reduction. Actions to reduce green house emission could be hard not only because people are not willing to change their lifestyle for environmental improvement (some people did, but mostly just ignoring the fact that global temperature is rising). 
 <br><br>
Electrical bicycle is a great alternative of transportation, especially for vehicles. Bike is more convertible and still able to satisfy people’s transportation needs. High population density cities are mostly suffering from traffic and limited parking spaces. But based on safety problem, the implementation of electrical bicycle is not a popular choice for people. There is hard to reach a balanced point to both ensure the safety of citizens and to reduce carbon emission.

I agree with your point. If everyone on earth could have plant based diets, reduce their consumption, and choice to ride e-bikes instead of cars, the global greenhouse gases emission would undeniably drop. However, this is nearly impossible to achieve because of various reasons. People are reluctant and involuntary to change once they have adapted and become familiar with somethings. In order to make people to really change, a mandatory force need to exist. In this case, this mandatory force could be laws and bills. We can become climate activist to advocate a green life styles and even become politicians that can implement effective environmental conservation laws. And, like Ken mentions, if you do care about our planet but don’t have much time to contribute, the most effective and simple thing you can do is to vote for environmental friendly politicians and leaders.

Biking is a great way to cut down our carbon footprint, and it is a great form of exercise. I bike every day to my classes and it is a very efficient way of travel given that there are dedicated bike paths that run from one end of campus to the other. However, in many cities, this is not the case. As Ken mentioned, he has to bike along a very narrow shoulder of the road, where he is very exposed to adjacent cars going 50 miles per hour. In my hometown, San Francisco, this was the case for a while. The bike lanes are often a very narrow strip denoted by white paint. However, there have been changes in the past few years. Although not as nice as the bike lanes in Copenhagen with the trees planted on the dividers, San Francisco has made bike lanes safer in the busy downtown area. They moved the parking spots for cars to be placed in between car traffic and the bike lanes, creating a safety wall while not having to burn space creating a designated, discrete bike path. Unfortunately, this is only happening in some areas, and the majority of bike lanes are still just white paint. Hopefully, this will continue to the rest of the city. Another negative for biking in San Francisco are the hills. No one wants to bike 5 blocks up a steep hill. It's way easier to drive.  I think a solution could be electric bikes, which would allow people to easily go up the hill without physically exerting themselves too much. Hopefully, these changes to the city infrastructure can start to show up in other cities and we can make bike riding more prevalent than cars.

I enjoyed reading your comment. I agree with your thoughts on biking. I think it is an amazing alternative to driving especially when you live in a city and are only traveling short distances throughout the day. What I find tough about biking everywhere is that I like to travel with friends when possible and I am also worried about being hit by a car when the only thing protecting me is a helmet. What San Francisco has recently done is designate heavily populated streets only for bikes and public transportation. This solves both the problems and would be great if other cities would do the same.

I do not understand how they can conclude that personal individual lifestyle changes are not going to get us there when we haven’t had a country commit to that promise before. If the entire nation was focused on making lifestyle changes, could it be enough? Why are we moving straight to unrealistic, extremely expensive, and difficult ideas first? I guess what I’m trying to say is that the Earth is so unpredictable that there’s really no way to know how it’ll react to the smaller changes. 
 <br><br>

Another interesting point that was brought up in the Lecture video today was the stress upon Climate Activism. I too am energized by the changes that can be brought on due to activism. Strong activists such as Greta Thunberg are the future of our world and I recognize that. It made me happy when Professor Hiltner discussed being a strong proponent of activism because that is something I value as well. 
 <br><br>

One thing that made me chuckle was when Professor Hiltner discussed biking as a mode of transport and the difficulties that come with that. He talked about the danger that would come with biking in is city. It made me wonder where Hiltner resides as Santa Barbara certainly doesn’t seem fazed by the bike dangers. 
 <br><br>

I was surprised but also pleased to hear that 62% of people commute to school/work via bicycle. That number seems much higher than I would have guessed. It also made me wonder if Copenhagen has the highest percentage or was just being randomly cited.

I agree that one cannot simply change their own lifestyle and expect the world to automatically get better, one person is not enough. Sadly, like Ken mentioned, even if every single person on this earth became vegan we would still emit a deadly level of fuels into the atmosphere continuing to increase our global temperatures. I agree with Ken that we need to begin making said changes in our lifestyles because, even though one individual does not have that much of an impact, over time, if everyone started become more environmentally efficient and advocating for the planet then we may be able to save the earth. I feel that UC Santa Barbara is a great example, like Copenhagen, of a transportation efficient community with the vast majority of the community using bikes or skateboards. 62% of Copenhagen citizens use bicycles as their means of travel to and from school or work on a daily basis. Ken mentioned finding parking on this university's campus portraying it to be difficult and a long journey from the majority of classes, and as a student at this university I would agree with his statement. I applaud Ken for biking to school every morning, putting himself in the way of harmful vehicles who, with one wrong move, could end his life like 4 other Santa Barbara bikers sadly experienced. As students going into this school it was almost expected to have a bike learning at Spring Insight and Orientation that bikes have the right of way which...if you have almost been ran over by a biker or have actually been ran over you understand the truth in that statement. I wish that more faculty on this campus would bike to campus but after listening to Ken speak of the only 2 bike lanes that are potentially extremely dangerous and having knowledge that most people would rather get to their location faster than take longer to bike I understand why the majority of the faculty on the UCSB campus do not bike. 
 <br><br>

We need to assist our world so that it won't perish under the hands of humans by becoming activists for the climate crisis and open the eyes of those around us about what they are truly being preached by the representatives of this country and their media. I have encountered so many people that rolled their eyes as soon as the words "climate change" and "global warming" came out of my mouth and some of them, a majority of them actually, were people around my age, 18-20 yrs old. Similar, my boyfriend reacted the same way but instead of cutting me off or shutting me down like some people I have encountered, he let me talk and explain to him all of the material we have covered in this course, slowly opening up his mind to what some people think is "the possibility that climate change may be real". While I am not one to push topics onto people if I can clearly tell it is not wanted, but sadly the more I learn about this crisis the more I realize there is so much that must be done and we are almost out of time to do so. In order to save our planet, hopefully, we must act fast and the only way to do so is to push this information into people's faces. We need to stop allowing the political parties and the media to voice opinions on the Green New Deal if they have not thoroughly read the proposal and truly understood where the creators were coming from. By allowing these people to spread these untrue and exaggerated statements about the Green New Deal and what they think it is about it is brainwashing the American people and creating a party divide that, if the citizens were given the truth, would not exist. I think that voting for those for climate change is most effective as it gives a voice to the people who normally would not get a say at all. With that being said, I believe that if someone wants to vote they need to educate themselves on every candidate and their goals before simply choosing said candidate because they saw "climate reform" or the need to help the climate within one's campaign.

Like Ken and you, I agree that one cannot simply change their own lifestyle and expect the world to automatically get better. I find myself struggling when I am just craving a burger or really want a new pair of jeans that I do not need and consider how little my own individual impact is. However, in order to aid the impact I hope to see I have to control myself in order to expect the same from others. Even with the small impact that individual lifestyle changes have, we still have to do whatever we can to stop the continuation of polluting our world. Just like Alyssa expressed I truly believe that UC Santa Barbara is a great starting place for the new foundation of a society I hope we are able to build. Setting an example like Copenhagen is a great way to start initiating a full transition for all UC campuses. Our bike culture largely contributes to our attitude as a green campus without even noticing. Just like in Copenhagen, more than half of our student population is not closer to over ninety percent bike or walk everywhere they need to. Biking not only is an easy way to get exercise everyday and contribute to the fight against the increase of pollution the environment but also is a way to avoid the headache that is parking. Especially in Los Angeles where I’m from parking is more than a nightmare. Being able to bike would eliminate not only the stress that comes with parking in Los Angeles but unfortunately it would be so extremely dangerous due to the way the streets are organized. Additionally, driving in a city like Los Angeles leads to crazier and crazier drivers every time. I would be so fearful of biking in the Santa Monica area. Ken is so extremely brave for biking and I really hope that he is able to be continually safe. Even here where bikes are a common way of life accidents are common especially for freshman in the beginning of the year. I was so fearful of biking at the start of school that I would park my bike in Isla Vista and walk. I completely understand people who refuse to bike to campus or to and from work when the bike path conditions are so dangerous. This just shows the importance of a bottom up approach regarding change that could help us advance in the right direction for decreasing CO2 emissions. Voting is arguably more important now than ever.

Taking personal actions to change your impact on the world is a good first step and way to remind yourself daily of the ongoing climate crisis and how your little actions matter. However personal action alone is not enough to combat the problem. Although excess meat production and consumption is the leading cause for greenhouse gasses, even a world wide diet change wouldn’t be enough to heal the planet. The issue expands all sectors of culture and society, requiring mass activism and political action. In order to make progress on global solutions climate activists must step forward and get politician’s and the public’s attention. The importance of voting cannot be expressed enough especially since many see the climate crisis in a cynical way and as an incurable problem tax and the Green New Deal and find ways to educate one another in a more open and unbiased way. By watching other successful sustainable systems like Copemnhagen, that use alternative emissionless forms of transportation like cycling, we too can make productive efforts to reduce the damage of climate change.

<p>

For me, personal action is the form of climate activism I am most comfortable with. Though I know that it seems like the easiest option or the lazier option, I do feel that it is extremely important and effective. In making personal changes to live a more sustainable life, I have inspired my parents, two people who once showed little concern over reducing their emissions, to change their lifestyle to the point where they are eating a mostly plant-based diet, and have started composting at our home in Oregon. Along with this, as someone who hopes to become and educator one day, I feel that in teaching young children to live sustainable lights and adopt practices such as composting, reducing how much meat they consume, and taking mass transport or bikes rather than a car, creates a huge impact as it halts the ideology that is currently being passed down through generations which is that we should consume as much as we can with little regard to our carbon footprint. While I am aware that enough change to significantly reduce our emissions as an entire country means that we need to do far more than make individual lifestyle changes, I think the impact that one can make on a personal level should not be disregarded as it can influence others and with time can be the start of something bigger.

I agree we need to drastically improve public transportation and using bikes instead of cars is a wonderful concept but its not realistic for the majority of people who work more than 5 miles from home. I disagree with Ken in his notion that adding bike lanes will play a serious role in mitigating the climate crisis. Yes Copenhagen radically shifted to a biking as the main mode of transportation and while we can encourage people here to follow suit, adding bike lanes will have minuscule effects in comparison. Los Angeles alone is almost twice the size of Copenhagen and has 7 times more people. While it is impressive they were able to achieve what they did, the U.S. and California itself is a whole other beast. I've seen countless towns and cities that have implemented protected bike lanes and have not noticed any sort of influx in cyclists. Since adding bike lanes means taking driving lanes away, they really only serve to cause more traffic, which causes more accidents, as well as more CO2 emissions since the drive now takes longer. Yes, if we could all bike to work that'd be great but there are so many other circumstances outside of dangerous street biking which prevent people from riding to work everyday that adding bike lanes simply won't make an impactful difference.

I would agree that implementation of bike navigability does not necessarily increase those choosing to bike instead of drive, as it much depends on the particular place you are discussing. You mentioned Los Angeles; however I want to point out the city of Seattle. The city and its suburbs have been trying to increase bike-ability while they stall on rail development, as a way to increase “green” transportation. However, in Seattle it is extremely difficult for this to become feasible. It is constantly wet, making biking both uncomfortable and more dangerous, as well as it is hilly, making biking more difficult, routes longer, building effective infrastructure more difficult, and again, making it more dangerous. I would love to see a more case-by-case solution system for low-carbon transportation be implemented, rather than a “bike fad” be spread, because not everywhere is as conducive to or as simple to implement bike travel as Copenhagen or Santa Barbara.

The lecture stresses the importance of both personal action and political involvement. At this point, climate change will not be slowed by personal action. What we need is a large global movement in which education is spread on the dangers of continuing this lifestyle. It is important to contribute as much effort as you can to climate change, yet it is also important to not burn yourself out, or scare off other people by forcing too much onto them. We should avoid blaming others, and instead focus on education and slowly introducing changes to society. A gradual change is much more likely to happen as opposed to something sudden.

I completely agree with Ken when he states that although people switch to a plant-based diet, it is ridiculous to believe that everyone on the planet will do so as well. All that is needed is one person to say “no” on the matter of changing to a plant-based diet for other people to follow with the excuse of “If that person isn't doing it, why should I?”. Then a group of people is formed that resist the environmental movement. Thereby preventing the achievement of zero percent methane emission from the beef industry, which would undoubtedly help with the fight against climate change. 
 <br><br>

Nonetheless, as also mentioned in the lecture video, we must also address the fracking industry. The fracking industry emits large amounts of methane into the atmosphere. It is important to reemphasize that methane lasts for a hundred years in the atmosphere and like carbon dioxide, it is responsible for heating up the planet. In order to address the problem, it is suggested to vote against fracking practices and to become an environmental activist. However, I see these suggestions as time-consuming meaning that no immediate action will be taken after voting or protesting. This is frustrating because throughout the course we have discussed how we don't have much time left until the world becomes unavailable for all living organisms. This is not hard to see as the news reports about the addition of new animals in the list of endangered species, plus the destruction of forests by massive wildfires, the loss of the coral reef, the land near the ocean being flooded and the list of destruction continues. Therefore, these two suggestions must be practiced together yet should not be limited only to voting and protesting, there should be more that we can do to help the fight go further on, quicker.

I agree with both you and Ken on your statements about the public turning to plant-based diets. When it comes to individual lifestyle changes, humans tend to be selfish; many people are unlikely to change parts of their lifestyle if it hinders their life in any way. Even if it’s for the greater good (in this case, the health of the climate), people are often lazy and continue to build off the laziness of others, leading to a downward spiral of inaction. To most omnivorous people, switching to a plant-based diet requires lots of effort. Additionally, it’s hard for people to motivate themselves to make the switch because they cannot see the immediate, point-source benefits of their lifestyle change. Because of this, it is essential that plant-based substitutes taste good and are easily accessible, and that people realize the positive impact they can have on their individual climate footprint by switching to a plant-based diet.

 <br><br>

Additionally, I resonate with your frustration surrounding the fracking industry. While, yes, it is extremely important that we vote to stop all fracking, I am unfortunately pessimistic about the speed in which this can happen. The climate crisis is a time-sensitive situation, and action must be taken now. Because of this, we cannot stand down to the people in power holding the fracking industry on its high pedestal. Voting against fracking should definitely be a main focus in large-scale reduction of fossil fuel emissions. Simultaneously, we must also continue to make smaller-scale changes to our lifestyles in order to fight the climate crisis in a timely manner.

I used to think that my personal behavior would not affect the environment at all, because my strength as a person is too small, but this class really solves some puzzles about whether my personal behavior will affect climate change. Admittedly, activists, voting and individual actions are all interrelated forces that will affect our environment to some extent, so if we only look at environmental issues from one perspective, we will get wrong results. The example of Ken cycling to the University of California School Bus reminds me of the traffic and road conditions I have experienced here. Bicycle lane, or just a narrow area separated by white lines, is terrible when few people pass by by by bike. I just moved to Goleta when I was a sophomore, and I tried cycling to school. I don't think that thin white line can bring me any protection, but I think it is particularly dangerous when the car turns right. In China, on the contrary, bicycle lanes are separated from highways, and in recent years, the Chinese government has built bicycle highways in Beijing to promote green travel. I think this is the real investment to improve the environment.

The most important overarching point of this lecture was that no single solution will, on it’s own, end the climate crisis. With that being the case, it is essential that everyone makes any and all changes that they are able to as soon as they are able to make them. This consideration is even more important when considering the fact that many Americans, for example, have unique living conditions even compared to others one city or one state over. In effect, it is important that folks in Southern California bike as frequently as possible in place of driving because, especially in the winter, many people in Northern California (especially up in the Sierra Nevadas) can’t. It is important that folks in Northern California, especially those in the mountain and forested areas, fight for environmental and land preservation policies at the local level because many in Southern California don’t have the same local lands to protect. Along that same line, it is essential that people in urban and metropolitan areas take advantage of public transit because their neighbors in rural counties probably can’t, but both groups need to fight for that infrastructure to be developed. 
 <br><br>
Effectively, no single solution is enough and no single person can make the exact same changes given unique living conditions. For that reason, everyone must make the changes that they are able to and actively vote/lobby/support initiatives that make further change possible.

You make an important point about there being no catch-all solution that everyone can follow to resolve an issue as large as the climate crisis and it's almost embarrassing to admit that I thought there had to be one. The environment one lives in plays a significant role in how one can and should act to take the necessary steps, however small, to change the status quo of climate change for the better.

In my opinion, although these three factors--personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active--have different impacts, they are connected together closely. When people start to change their own actions, they are kind of on the road to become climate activists. If they create successful and impactful activism, they will gain the power to force political enforcement on many climate issues, such as fossil fuels. In the video, Ken mentioned that even the combination of all personal actions, it is still not enough. This fact makes me a little sad. But this does not mean we should stop changing. Even if the impact is small, it is still an impact. Later in the video, Ken pointed out the other two things we can do to produce greater influence: voting and activism. We should vote for candidates who care about climate change, thus many good proposals can be implemented. The environmental movement in the 1970s changes the current situation in Denmark: there are roads for bikes, so many people prefer to ride to work. It's time to start a revolution around the world.

Great comment! I believe we share some thoughts in common. As the professor says in the video, many people now start to argue whether it is sufficient for people to take action on their own instead of let the government to take action. Clearly, as the data states, personal effort is not enough to counter the damage we caused to the climate. There has to be a way for the policy makers to be alarmed and put political action on it. 
 <br><br>

Personally, I believe that policy and the personal action can exert mutual support to each other. Take the e-bike mentioned by professor for an example, if the government can find a way to build a proper bike path for people to bike safely, then, there will be more people willing to switch their daily transportation to bikes.
 <br><br>

However, that doesn’t mean that the personal action is not essential. If people are alarmed enough, they can make some proposal and help the government with its policy, just like those people who came up with the “Green New Deal”. I believe that all of the actions are equally important toward this climate issue.

Personal action is always the start of any major change. If you can make these small personal changes in your life, how could you expect someone to follow in your footsteps and make these changes along with you? Many people in the world, however, will not make these changes on their own. Also, switching to a largely plant-based diet as Kent said, won’t make people switch to reusable energy. Many people could or would be willing to make small changes, but at the end of the day, they are going to make changes that are easy for them and still doable. Also, it’s crazy how political action is the hardest type of action to happen. If more Americans voted for candidates that have no fossil fuel connections, we could get so much more done as Ken said. People need to start voting for candidates that will actually listen to the people and what they want to see a change in the country. But at the end of the day, climate activism and personal action can spark great change in the world. Any influential person in this world started with personal change and activism. Just like Martin Luther King Jr. did and slowly gained more support and popularity among those who had different views. He was able to change the whole entire country. Also, biking in a small country is realistic, but the United States is a very large and urban country. However, the US could start investing in railways to the cities and bike paths where people work. But still, cars will be necessary for those who do work in very rural areas or with small populations.

Ken’s lecture takes a deep dive into how much can personal action, climate activism and politically activism contribute to mitigating climate crisis. As far as I’m concerned, all of them need to be addressed at the status quo. In terms of personal changes, collective power is always greater than expected, even if everyone stops having meat for just one day out of a week will make a huge difference. Frankly speaking, it’s hard for me to completely get rid of meat product or beef, while slightly reducing the amount is feasible. Regarding the political and climate activism, I was fascinated by the point when Ken illustrated that everyone could make a difference despite you are a celebrity or high school students like Greta Thunberg. The future depends on us all as human beings. There is no denying that voting is the easiest and least time-consuming way for normal citizens to get involved in mitigating climate crisis. I was proud of students who were constantly promoting the significant of voting in UCSB campus and the prevailing trend that everyone has registered to vote.
 <br><br>
I used to bike to school during my high school years in China and just as Ken listed, it has several benefits such as avoiding busy traffic and doing exercise. This video also presents another aspect of Copenhagen for being a city of bikes. I sincerely suggest that other countries should take advantage of their policy and publicize it. As illustrated in the video, American as a huge economy leader ought to contribute more to environmental issues globally which turns out to be a win-win situation, itself will ultimately be benefited.

I do agree that collective power is more powerful than we think. Your solution of not eating meat once a week seems practical. Christians already do this during a certain time of the year where they don't eat meat (besides fish) on Fridays. If devoted Christians can pull this off, I believe, as a nation, we can pull this off too. When Ken talked about the dangers of biking on the roads, I never really thought about how dangerous it was. It shocked me that the same path that Ken takes to campus had someone die. We need to change our bike lanes. They're literally only a couple feet. We need either separate roads or some other option where it makes it safer for commuters on bikes.

Climate activism is an essential step in the right direction for our environment. Ken explains how activism, voting, and personal actions are very important to saving the planet. I was confused by this statement, although I agree with it, it seems to contradict past statements about how personal changes are too late to fix the climate crisis. We need to end our fossil fuel emissions now, not just go vegan. Yes, we need to bike instead of drive cars. Yes, we need to elect policy makers who actually care about our planet and will take steps to enact the necessary steps to fix the disaster we have created. So voting is important but we need it to happen now, and we need everyone on the same page. Copenhagen sets a good example for America, but is it enough at the stage we are at? Will Americans really stop driving their cars if they already can’t switch to veggie burgers? I really hope change is made soon, and hope what we do is enough, but I am very pessimistic about the future of our planet.

In my opinion, personal action, climate activism, and being politically active are all equally important in helping to bring attention to the climate crisis. However, they all bring attention to different aspects of the crisis. For example, becoming informed (and informing others) about the voting process can help federal and local leaders implement policies that will help guide a city/nation to a much more sustainable lifestyle that must be lived in order to reduce global warming. Climate activism does well in bringing attention to the true horror of the consequences that we will endure if we do not act expeditiously. At many climate protests (such as the one in Santa Barbara just a few weeks ago), people make signs or banners that include statistics and projections of the horrific realities we will face in the coming decades if we do not reverse the overall warming trend. This, at least in theory, should scare people enough to act. Personal action helps with reducing support to some of the largest carbon-emitting industries in the world (less support = less profits = less incentive to emit). It also reduces one's overall footprint, which if done collectively, can help reduce the overall amount of CO2 put into the atmosphere.
 <br><br>


Take biking at UCSB, for instance. Roughly 2/3 of all students on campus commute to classes via biking, as well as making their way through Isla Vista. With this observation in mind, it's fair to say that IV's cumulative carbon footprint is, on average, probably much lower than that of your typical suburban town. Sure, everything in IV is very structured and close together (which is not the case in many suburban environments), but if roads and cities were to be structured around bicycle convenience, like Copenhagen, then it would be much more practical to rely on biking as a main mode of transportation as opposed to cars.

<p>
If everyone went vegan, it still won’t be enough. This fact was moving because it is factually true that humans have many impacts that contribute to the climate change. The solutions that Ken gives us is to vote, be politically active, and choose candidates who have similar interests. Fracking in particular is the bigger problem with the extraction of gas and oils releasing both carbon and methane into the environment. As he further states, the gorilla in the room is transportation which uses up the extracted gasoline results people to contribute to the increase of their personal carbon footprints. It is important to be politically active about the environment because you should have a voice and a matter in how you want your life to be. 
 <br><br>

I especially thought it was really relatable when Ken mentioned biking systems. Biking in Copenhagen unlike America has integrated, protected systems of bike lanes after the realization of an environmental crisis since the 1900’s. I feel like America discourages many people from biking as a transport turning them to cars or planes for long distance travels especially the fact that nearly everyone ends up without a driver’s license really tells us something. In fact, there are many bike accidents per day around Santa Barbara and California in general. Even walking can sometimes be dangerous as some cars do not stop at stop signs. I would know cause I almost got run over by a car while crossing a stop sign in IV a couple of days ago. This is not even the first time this has happened like it’s crazy how dangerous roads can be. Overall, our voice matters because we can implement safety into our lives and change the way certain topics are stigmatized.

To vote maybe is an option for people, but what if when the people get elected and act differently? I highly doubt that I do not think that is a helpful way of solving the climate issue. To be politically active is not really helpful. For example, the white house has a petition for people and they said they will act when the petition reaches a certain number of signatures. Do or did the white house act? that is a question. Taylar Swift as one of the most famous American singer started a petition regarding the Equality Act and reaches the required amount of signatures quickly, but did the government act? The people in the United States are really politically active from my perspective, but sometimes or even most of the time that those protests or petitions seem meaningless to the politicians. 

 <br><br>

To bike is impossible in the United States, the markets are far and the bike cannot carry anything at all when you have much stuff. It is impossible for people to walk to the market when they just want to buy some vegetables. The United States implemented a highway system that forces everyone to drive and to be honest it is really simple and easy to get a diver license in the United States. Also, it is not just dangerous for the bikers it is also dangerous for the car drivers as well. Sometimes car drivers have to share the road with the bikers and it is difficult for divers to see those bikers. When I drive in IV,  I become highly cautious, because there too many bikers running really fast and hard to perceive.

I agree with Ken that personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active all work hand in hand when it comes to the issue of climate change, but I believe that the main one that can help us the most is political involvement. Changing our dietary habits and our form of transportation to be more environmentally friendly are great and we should all make those goals in our lives but the effects are not enough to combat the Climate Crisis. What we need is to pay attention to politics and vote for politicians who prioritize the climate issue and make proposals like The Green New Deal. I think that this year is going to be a very crucial and defining year for the climate crisis because it will really make or break the situation. The time to take action is now and we have to put people in charge who will do the right thing and give us a chance at a brighter future.

I think the three choices of personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active are important, but I believe that being politically active and climate activism has more impact than personal action. As much as it shouldn't be, climate change has become a political issue, and as of right now, Ken's generation, the generation of climate deniers, is in charge of the government right now, which is why not much has been done about the climate crisis. In order to combat this, we must become more politically active and vote. This lecture further emphasized how important voting is. If we do not vote, there will be no change in the government, and we will be stuck with the same group of climate deniers. Even though I think that climate activism and being politically active is more important than personal action, I still believe that personal action is important too. If we ourselves do not do what we preach, nothing would get done in regards to actual fighting against climate change.

The little things we do will not be enough to save our world. We need to convince everyone else to make these changes too or else we will still end up with climate problems we won’t be able to fix. Voting is the most important thing we can do to really see a change. There are many people who won’t change unless they have to so we must make them have to change. Many people will not willingly change their ways, they must be forced to make the change and while this may seem aggressive, it’s what’s necessary to help save the Earth. Greenhouse gas emissions will not go down unless we get the politicians to put in laws, carbon taxes, or even just to make it easier to be an activist. Just like with Copenhagen saving 3.8 billion pounds of CO2 because of bikes. Not as many people would be riding bikes if they hadn’t pushed for politicians to make the bike paths safer and more effective. If people are given an easy opportunity to become more environmentally conscious, they’ll do it. But when being environmentally conscious causes problems, like unsafe bike paths or even more expensive food options (vegan), then fewer people will want to overcome those problems.

While we can all try and do our part to help mitigate the climate crisis, in the grand scheme of things we are one of billions of people that are emitting CO2. I'm not saying that our efforts die the moment we make them, but our personal actions can only take us so far. Climate activism is amazing and it's essential to creating a better future for everyone and educating people on what we need and should do, but I still remember the quote that "knowledge is power squandered unless acted upon." And I think what the best thing we can do is to vote. How are we going to make a change by ourselves when the opportunity for our voices to be heard on a large-scale is coming soon? By voting, you're directly letting America know how you feel. This is how our knowledge is not squandered; we elect officials that will do what we want, and we choose our future America and our future world. It's so easy to do so, and it makes a big impact along with going vegan or shopping sustainably. Voting has been and always will be the constant in our lives that gives us the power to choose how we want our future to look like.

Bike infrastructure is severely under developed worldwide. I was born in San Diego, a large city, and yet it isn't bike friendly at all. You would think a place as large as San Diego would have more developed bike paths, however it remains largely a car city. I like the idea of an ebike, however it scares me to ride my bike on roads where nothing is there to protect me. Not only do accidents happen which is an associated risk to riding bikes, but there are plenty of times drivers don't even see or look out for bikes. Its ridiculous to require bikes to share the road with large metal killing machines. If we want to make bikes a feasible form of transportation, we have to invest in safe bike paths. 
 <br><br>

Being politically active is so important in regards to environmental activism. I agree with everything Ken said in his video, but I'd like to add being politically active is important for knowing the facts. Often times when people don't keep up with politics they get bits and pieces and often have a misconception on issues or policies that are being discussed. When you do your research it makes you a better informed voter and allows you to spread correct information to those around you as well.

I am also from San Diego and agree that the city is very bike-unfriendly.  My father works downtown and I hear him complain about the e-scooters on a regular basis, the drivers hate them but you aren't allowed to use them on the sidewalks.  What could have been a great addition to the city for tourists to reduce their carbon footprint turned into a nuisance for everyone. I also agree that being politically active is very important. I try to post about as much as I can on social media, but still find myself blocking certain family members from seeing my story in order to reduce tension.  This is a personal problem I need to get over, withholding those facts from those people can only hurt.

Individual efforts contribute little to our environment, just like our votes contribute nearly nothing in statistical perspectives. However, society is made up of small individuals, and we should not ignore the interaction among people. For example, Ken himself influences at least hundreds of people, who would then influence more or less their social circles. As more and more people advocate bikes, the bike lane will improve with the increase in demand. This is like positive feedback, which has a sort of exponential curve. In the beginning, the improvement looks pretty flat and linear, as many people complain that the bike lanes are unsafe. However, as riding bikes become more and more trendy, the bike lane will get better and better. Therefore, I really have positive attitudes toward individual efforts.

Taking personal action is most critical if we actually want to see a change in the world. We can’t rely on others to make a change for us. Individually, we can step up as humans with purpose and start changing the way we live in order to help slow climate change. We need to start better educating ourselves on the long term effects of climate change and how what we do helps. As mentioned in the video, simply changing our diets and essentially going vegan would not be enough. One of the most significant actions we can do is take the time to vote. We can vote for representatives who will address climate change and try to find solutions rather than simply deny it. I realized there many other things I can also do to slow down climate change after watching the video. Its inspiring to see the measures Ken takes to do his part on this global issue. Riding a bike to and from work can be very time consuming and exhausting, but there's sacrifices we must be willing to make if we want to see some real change. It’s critical to question all approaches to life and spread the word. Spreading the word solves the issue of questioning the little difference that one of us makes.

I think that being politically active and political activism are just as important to each other. We are lucky enough to live in a country that allows us to speak out against our government and change it. We cannot waste this privilege we have. That being said political activism only works when those we elected to office continually fail to deliver on their promises. When we do have a choice to change those in office we need to take advantage of it. We need to elect politicians who are willing to get things done and promote a change we agree with, not just sit around and do nothing.  In these ways political activism and being politically active almost compliment each other. Being active means you can put those you want in office, and political activism makes those in office do something when it is not an election year. I reiterate that we are lucky to live in a country where these things are possible, so we need to take advantage of them and incite some change.

Ken says that our cultural changes are not significant enough that it will have a profound effect on the global climate. Without an alternative cleaner energy we can't move away from fracking and other cheaper fossil fuels. I think even though renewable energy options such as wind and solar are becoming cheaper and widespread it simply won't be enough for our current consumption needs. I think an energy option that we don't take into account is nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is widely unpopular in the US because people are scared of them due to their reputation in causing disasters. Most of these accidents were caused by carelessness or nature disasters, and can easily be avoided if we channel our money toward it. Nuclear energy can benefit a lot of people and produce vast amounts of energy that the US needs.

The Copenhagen bikes are something that we should be striving to build here in the United States. Well really any sort of safe bike lanes. One of the reasons I don’t use bike lanes when I’m back home is because how dangerous it is. Lots of people have been killed or very injured by cars when they bike around on bike lanes. It’s always saddening seeing the flowers and crosses next to the streets. I always tense up when I have to drive next to a biker. I’m not even the one biking and I feel unsafe for them. The bike likes in Copenhagen and the biking culture there I’m sure didn’t happen overnight or probably in the same decade. However we need to see these changes as fast as possible. We don’t have much time left. The best thing we can do as this video points out is being an activist and more importantly VOTE! Hopefully everyone here has registered to vote already since it’s an election year and there’s a certain Cheeto boy who we’d certainly need to get out office to make any real change. Vote in the democratic primaries and the general election. Maybe more importantly research local elections and vote for climate centered candidates.

I do believe that personal changes do good. But the down side to this is that many people do not want to change their consumerist ways of living. Personal action should be one thing that people should take into account because it does make a change. If you could vote you need to, as ken said one way of hopefully making changes is by putting candidates who would want environment changes to happen. I do agree with what Ken Said that being active but specially politically active, for the climate crisis is a great way to start change. I know a lot of people from back home who do not think that voting is important which is very frustrating. Climate change crisis will continue to progress if things don’t change. Biking is something that I enjoy. Making bike lanes and making them secure would really help out the climate crisis. This would help out by cutting down the use of cars. I think that advocating for this like new and secure bike lanes will be worth it and really beneficial.

I agree with Ken when he believes that personal action, climate activism and being politically active are all related with each other. What we do on a day to day basis in terms of the overall climate impact is relatively small. Not eating one burger doesn't really make much of a difference when comparing to the rest of the world, which could be a reason why some don't see the point in making daily lifestyle changes. However as seen in the past, grassroots organizations can make a significant change. Once people adopt a more sustainable lifestyle, they can share with others how they made it work and how it really isn't that bad once you get used to it. They point out what the positives about it are and how it makes them feel that they have been able to do this. They then can discuss ways that can make these even better and more glamorous to the public, such as his example of creating more accessible and safe bike lanes in Santa Barbara Once enough people agree and adopt similar lifestyle changes, they can then go to local government and propose changes that affect the infrastructure of the town (ex. bike lanes being safer) to ensure that the public will be on board with it.
<br><br>

He introduces the idea of leading by example, which is something that Copenhagen has done for the world. It's hard to imagine 62% of Americans taking their bike to work rather than a car, but that's because using a car is much more normalized and acceptable here. With the institutional change, this attitude can evolve to represent a more sustainable life that is upheld by infrastructural modifications. I think what Copenhagen has achieved needs to happen in the US because we are the greatest contributors to the problem and have been the economic leader on the planet for a long time. If other countries see that we can adopt these changes, then those in smaller and less developed countries can do it too. It's just a matter of getting politicians on board and using the right language and plans to appeal to them and ensure it seems like a viable option.

These are all great points, and I completely agree with you that normalizing patterns that contribute to healthier environmental action are crucial to fueling a mass shift in progressive environmental thinkinging and aggressive climate-focused action. But, with that being said, do you think that the implementation of simply adding bike lanes would cause people to ride bikes more? Sure, it would probably catalyze a group of environmentally like-minded people to change their current patterns, but do you think there also needs to be urban planning changes or shifts in normalizing different sorts of daily transportation/migration patterns? I think in terms of my own life as an example: I currently live in Isla Vista and commute downtown 2-3 times a week to work. This commute takes around 20 minutes. If I were to bike, it would practically triple to quadruple that, maybe more. I am not saying I wouldn't do it; but what I am saying is that making the conscious decision to commit myself to that tri-weekly commute would be a big decision in my life, and it would be something I would have to seriously ponder, weighing the pros and cons in my current life. I think that this sort of environmentally friendly shift is a topic that must be discussed more frequently. And while the infrastructure is undoubtedly important, will it ever serve useful if people don’t actually commit their time, physical effort, life planning, and passions around this concept? Part of me thinks some excited patrons would, but the other part of me thinks that people are too complacent with how their lives are going now.

The idea of individual action is a concept that I feel many become conflicted with. I know there is a great number of people hoping to make a difference in the climate crisis, but as much as these people are hoping for this, many remain unwilling to actually do something about it. Whether it be consuming less meat, changing methods of transportation, adopting a more minimalist lifestyle, or voting, people seem to support the idea without taking action. This may be changed, however, with more focus on the concept of the ‘bandwagon’. People tend to be followers by nature and tend to be more comfortable doing something they see has already been done and thus know it is actually doable. For example, in Isla Vista and on campus, we see a huge backing in voter registration supporters. They go so far as to walk entire lecture halls through the registration process. This proves to be much more effective than waiting for people to do it on their own because exposing those on the edge to those actually taking part encourages them to do so as well. This perfectly embodies the effective strategy of ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ and shows this can be made possible on an even larger scale. Although getting people to register is a great method in creating change, many of those registered won’t research the topics or even participate in voting. We may need an influential leader or group to use the  concept of the ‘bandwagon’ to further encourage people to do so.

I think in the same way as you. Many people say without actually bringing out a different action. In Santa Barbara, the bike lanes are perfectly constructed for bikers to safely go from place to place. Everyday I see a phenomenon–– people mostly bike to school faster than those taking other transportation. However, I go to school by bus even though I have my own bike. Since I feel more convenient taking the bus, I sometimes bike to school when I’m almost late for class. I think this can be an alternative for students to start making a small difference to mitigate climate change. A tiny step counts as an improvement.

This video makes me realize riding bike is more than a green way to transport, it can show people around me my attitude regarding saving the energy and thus towards climate change. I do think it is pointless arguing whether individual actions like turn off the lightbulb while leaving is effective regarding the climate change. In fact, I believe every little action should be cherished. There is an old saying in Chinese saying when all drops of water comes together, there will be a river. No matter what others are doing, whether they are doing their parts to save the planet, you should first do what you can do, ie turn off the lights, use bikes instead of driving alike.  It's true people can't fully change in a couple of days, but we can start from trivial aspects like eat less meat than last week. With courage and determination, we can do what we want to do.

I enjoyed that saying and it is true, every little choice adds up and we must realize that change will only come with individual lifestyle decisions. Our habits and behaviors add up and we must now consider the environmental impacts of different consumptions. The United States needs to restructure our vehicle infrastructure into much more sustainable and efficient transportation systems, like trains, buses, bikes and walking. Almost 30% of the United States' greenhouse gas emissions originate from personal and commercial vehicle emissions. Cities and towns must prioritize developments into sustainable transportation but this happens only with environmentally conscious public officials. That is why it is so essential to research and vote in local elections.

I don’t think anything will happen without activism. As they say, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. If no one speaks out about climate change, who would care? I find it very unfortunate bike paths separate from roads aren’t a thing in the US. I enjoy riding my bike, but I just find it too dangerous to ride on the same road as a car going 40+mph. I’ve been in a few car accidents and seen the outcome of others, so I know what cars can do to another car, let alone a bicyclist. I do understand why owning a car is so popular in California though. California is such a large state that it takes hours to get anywhere. I have experience with having to drive 70 miles to commute to a class everyday, which I wouldn’t have been able to do with a bike. Hopefully one day bikes will have a separate area, but even with that, the convenience of a car in California is a bit too great to give up for long commutes.

Education is key! Climate activism is critical to our survival. I'm scared to ride my bike on campus, let alone on the open road. I skateboard and walk everywhere and carpool whenever possible. I think it's unfortunate that public transportation in California is unreliable. I hate riding the bus, but I know that it's good for the environment. I think it's alright to have a car as long as you limit your use and carpool with friends, family, ride-share, etc.!

Personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active all matter and interrelated. As Ken stated, local elections in Copenhagen prevented 3.8 billion pounds of carbon dioxide from being emitted. It is important to recognize that activists drive political action. Without pressure from activists, improving cycling infrastructure wouldn’t have been a priority. Politics seem to hold greater weight when dealing with issues such as the climate crisis. Trying to change millions of people’s (or companies’) behavior is extremely difficult, and there are many people who would not voluntarily change their lifestyle to help mitigate the climate crisis. Legislation would force those changes.
 <br><br>
Personal action is also important as it would be hypocritical to state you care for the environment without personally acting. As a student, I bought a bike for the convenience of getting to class quickly, and now have grown to love biking as a mode of transportation. My goal is to continue biking beyond my college years. The pedelec bike, which I was not very familiar with prior to this video, seems to be worth the investment as it would get me to destinations much quicker than my current road bike and roughly the same time with a car. At least with the bike, I would not be emitting nearly as much carbon dioxide.

I think the most important thing we need to do is becoming politically active, by both voting for candidates with a drive to solve this problem and publicly advocating for these candidates within our families and friend groups. We should also encourage our current politicians to do something about these problems. However, this is not an excuse to not take any personal actions and not change anything within our lives. We need a combination of efforts from a personal to political level to truly have the best chance of making our planet sustainable. It can be hard to make some personal changes. Things like finding an acceptable replacement for cars and other carbon intensive transportation methods can be difficult. Thus it takes political change through voting for oneself and others to make this change that can lead to a better life through better physical health, lower financial strains for transportation, and a better environment to live in.

Hello, I utterly agree with on this topic, considering how we're nearing the next presidential election. It's essential that we put politicians in power who actually care about the well-being of our Earth, especially now since our collective environmental problem is increasingly becoming a problem. Not only do we need politicians who care for the planet to pass environmentally-friendly bills, we need regular people to change their lifestyles from living in excess to living sensibly. Not only would it be beneficial for the planet, but it would be helpful for their mental and physical health. On the topic of candidates that would improve our nation's carbon footprint,  Bernie Sander would get the job done. Go Bernie! It's time to feel the Bern!!

One of the main reasons that I choose not to bike is because I feel unsafe about it. I literally was so surprised as a kid when I realized that the bike lane is on the roads with a mere white line separating the path from the car lane. Like what the hell is that white line really gonna do? When I ride on the bus and pass by bike riders, I get so anxious because they just seem so close to the cars and/or buses. If they made bike lanes more secure, I’m sure many people would feel more comfortable biking. I use this as an example for why voting is the most important thing for me to do. It’s important for everyone to vote actually, but it’s most important that we’re voting for the right people and the right policies. People have different ideas of what “right” is, so that’s kind of hard to say. But you can’t deny facts and when it comes to climate change, there are a lot of hard facts that people cannot continue to ignore. This kind of brings me back to the video describing tactical framing because it emphasizes that we need to ignore the politics and develop an understanding of the policy so that we can formulate our own opinions without any political influence. Once people can learn to do that (and I have hope that this generation and so on can learn quite easily) we can then look at the better candidate. Encouraging biking is just an example of one step, but there’s a lot we can do by having a voice and using the power of voting to spread that voice.

It's important for us to do our part and take individual action but as Ken mentioned, the most important and easiest thing we can do is vote. When we vote, we are selecting people to represent our views and it's important that we elect people who take climate change seriously and have a plan to do something about it. Through voting, we can pass legislation that forces people into taking action. One example that Ken gives us is that only through voting and legislation will we put a stop to fracking. Fracking puts out more emissions into the Earth than the beef industry does and we will only get alternatives if we fight for them. Sadly because people will not make changes to their daily lives on their own, we need legislation to be passed that will force Americans to stop consuming so much beef, flying in planes, and driving cars. There are plenty of alternatives that are better for the environment and our bodies. We enjoy these things because they are convenient but the reality is that they are not necessary. Americans need to stop seeing themselves as entitled to these things that are increasing carbon emissions because it is selfish and we need to take action now.

I’m proud that UCSB is doing a lot in terms of bike paths and bike racks. Yet, it’s still annoying to bike sometimes. The bike paths don’t connect everywhere and some are bumpy and cracked. 
 <br><br>
When I leave my room to bike, I often experience a feeling of unease. The road in front of some of the dorms is quite bumpy, cracked, and narrow. I remember driving in on my first day at UCSB and being greeted by this meh road. Now, I bike on it daily. It still makes me feel uncomfortable because there is no bike path on the road. The road’s already narrow, so cars can’t pass by when there’s a bike on the road. I’ve wondered many times why the sidewalk on one side of the road is so wide, but the road so narrow. I find it confusing why there are so many bike racks for the dorms, but no bike path on the main road where people would have to use to bike to classes. It’s a bit dramatic, but at night, I worry whether the car behind me will drive straight into me.
 <br><br>

Anyways, I’m more concerned with how to bike. I feel like most people don’t know how to bike when surrounded with other bikers. I’ve seen nasty accidents happen because someone didn’t signal they were turning. When coming to UCSB, one of the first things I learned was to yield to bikers when walking. Great, pedestrians know to avoid bikes, but bikes don’t know how to avoid other bikes. The only time I’ve been told how to ride a bike at UCSB is a video on roundabouts, which was helpful, but I’d greatly appreciate more information on biking etiquette and how to bike. If more people knew how to bike better and safely, then more people would be willing to ride bikes. I have several friends who abstain from riding bikes because they’ve seen painful bike accidents happen. People also avoid riding bikes because they’re not quite sure how to commute with a bike on a bike path or busy road. More concrete information would let more people dare to get on a bike.

<p>
I do agree that both climate activism and personal change are important. I have never thought so deeply about bikes until this lecture. For that, I appreciate the insight. I have not bought my own bike since coming to UCSB, but rather, have been using the HOPR bikes on campus. I am curious to hear what other people think about it. I would think that they'd be better in the long run, but only if their turnover rate is lower than that of the average personally-owned bike and if it doesn't cost too much (money and greenhouse gas emissions) to manufacture enough bikes for their service to be reliable and efficient. I was also inspired to think about the bike system at UCSB in general. I used to briefly consider joining UCSB's Associated Students Bike Committee, but figured it wasn't very relevant to me personally. I wonder how much they approach the situation as a method of making UCSB more sustainable. I plan to look into this later on! I also found it interesting that you could electrify your bike with a kit. Is this still a thing? If so, why don't more people do it?

Personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active. What matters more? Each are fundamental parts to acknowledge the climate crisis! I see these three intertwining for the cause. Climate activism is the root of it all and leads you to personal action and political activism for being passionate over the issue. We have talked a lot about personal action over the course of almost eight weeks now, but this past week has been more centered on being politically active. In class, we have reinforced the notion that we must use our voices, as a generation that cares more and are expected to overturn this climate crisis based on how badly impacted we are and our future offspring could be, and electing the right governmental officials is important for change to happen on the legal spectrum of things. Personal action is vital for the personal lifestyles adjustments to adhere, but actual legislation to regulate industries and confine them is extremely important, meaning being politically active is extremely important. As Ken pointed out, even if all people had large plant-based diets and refrained from meat, it would not be able to combat or compare to the effects of fracking.
 <br><br>

When I first vote, I want to be well-research and vote for the best candidate whose views align with mind. They need to care about the people and combating the climate crisis would be one of the important topics to me they would need to be an advocate for. I hope to become an active voter not only for the federal government, but in local affairs as well. It cannot just be me though, we need the support of others and word of mouth -- talking about this to loved ones -- may be more powerful than you think. It could add numbers of support and teach people to use their civic right responsibility.
 <br><br>

In a way, voting and political activism seem like the only way to use our voices. I just hope that our voices are actually heard and used to make a difference. 
 <br><br>

For example, I hope we get the opportunity to vote for bicycle lanes like in Copenhagen. Two quarters of the population commute by bike and the city accommodates for that. These bike lanes are specialized and have riders feel safe. I honestly love the change they made and would love to see that in the United States. It’s amazing that local political activists were listened to by their government to listen to them. By listening to the needs of the people, they reduce 3.8 billion lbs of CO2 emissions a year now! I like to imagine what it would be like to have this in my hometown, but there are roads poorly constructed that are currently not even safe for bikers. They are made too narrow and have no designated bike lane or they are narrow and cannot be built wider due to infrastructure on the sides. This is problematic and makes me sad because the changes would not be easy to tackle and sometimes when things are not easy, it will be considered as impossible.

I definitely agree that integrating all three (personal action, climate activism, and being politically active) is the most effective way of mitigating the climate crisis. Practicing a more sustainable life style, raising awareness about the climate crisis, and actively pushing your representatives to take action can definitely have an impact, no matter how small or big, on saving the planet. However, I do think that the easiest, most accessible, and most necessary thing that our generation needs to do is VOTE. Changing our society's ways of consumption unfortunately comes down to actions of politicians. Often times, their actions are guided by larger corporate interests and maybe there just aren't enough people voting. But I believe that if we vote and make our voices heard through these votes, especially at the local level, we can being to implement sustainable practices not just at the personal level, but at a societal level.

I agree that the most necessary thing our generation must do is vote. We can make all the personal lifestyle changes we want, and we might hopefully make a smell dent in the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, our personal actions can only do so much. The vast majority of the greenhouse gases we emit as a country come about through the economic system we run on. The only way to change the system is through laws, and the only ways to get laws written and enacted is by voting for politicians who will work for the communities who voted for them.
 <br><br>
Many people have begun to make lifestyle changes, but it is time to start making changes at the societal level too. Our planet cannot wait for everyone to decide to become vegan and stop driving cars and become minimalists. Our planet needs people to be pushed to make those better lifestyle choices by laws that have our environmental crisis in mind. We need laws that disincentivize meat, that place taxes on carbon, that prevent the cheap outsourcing of manual labor in order to get anywhere close to the zero-emissions pipe dream that is essential for maintaining a livable planet.

Now many people has carried out some personal actions about protecting our environment and induced some cultural changes. People began to change their ways of travel and eat more vegetable. In he real world, American people always drive alone which will hurt the environment a lot. They can choose take buses and trains to replace driving cars. But if we want to make a bigger change, we need to make some change among our society. Some older generation do not matter climate change a lot. How we can persuade them protect our planet together? Now there already have some efforts made by people. They installed the solar panel. They also changed the light bulb to reduce the consumption of energy. Policies also began to support environmentalists to protect our planet. This lecture make me feel very optimistic about our future.

I think it is so important to be politically active nowadays, because our vote is the most powerful tool we can use to save the planet.  Living a vegan diet, avoiding planes, and preventing food waste are all great things, but we need to push for actual change, like voting to end fracking, or to vote for better public transit, or voting in the GND. I can't believe that fracking is something that has passed through legislation so cleanly. Fracking is something that is so obviously bad for our planet, and voting against it is so important to do. just remember GO VOTE. Young voters need to VOTE.

The roles of personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active can and would help combat climate change. With personal action we can reduce our personal climate change, but as Ken mentions that is still not enough. With climate activism we can push for bigger change. Ken gives us an example of activism working in Copenhagen, regarding cycling and bike lanes. The activism in Copenhagen lead to the improvement of their bike lanes, which then lead to an increase of bike use and a decrease of car use. This example given to us by Ken shows how impactful and helpful activism can be. Becoming politically active helps out tremendously as well. Voting for the right people who want to prioritize combating climate change is a great way to create change in regards to climate change. Thanks to Ken, I am sure we all now know the importance of voting because he mentions it a lot in his lectures. With these three roles we can do a lot for our country and our planet.

No initiative is impactful unless everyone participates. Unless a majority if people vote for green policies, there will be no change. the same thing can be said for animal product consumption. After watching Cowspiracy I felt that my peers would have a deeper understanding of the dire impact that animal agriculture inflicts upon the Earth. By discounting the minimal effects of switching to a vegan diet, we legitimize the perpetuation of a terrible industry. So what a vegan diet doesn't reduce emissions as much as biking to work. Every single decision and every single act counts, regardless of how small a difference it makes. The cents add up before the dollars do. If millions upon millions of people all made these small changes in their diets, it would make a bigger difference. This fallacy of "I'm not going to go vegan because it doesn't do that much to save the planet" is an excuse from those with little discipline and little genuine motivation to care. 
<br><br>
That being said, I agree that we all need to start voting and advocating for green policies. It is such a simple thing to do and it takes up so little time. Like my argument on going vegan, this is a group effort. We need to collectively vote for these initiatives and show how strongly we feel if we want to make a difference. More importantly, we need to discern which candidates are using a green platform for political gain versus genuine policy change. Considering Governor Jerry Brown's refusal to ban fracking after saying that he wanted to shows that some politicians seek power rather than positive change in office. Copenhagen's success in banning cars was only accomplished because of the amount of support it received. If we were able to garner the same amount of support in California, it might be possible to ban fracking. At the end of the day, mitigating the impact of climate change will boil down to how lazy people decide to be: people can either make the necessary effortful changes, or they can pay lip service to the cause without doing the hard work required to turn words into deeds.

I think the biggest problem right now is that a vast majority of the population with voting rights are still massively undereducated regarding the issue of climate change and ignorant about the detrimental results  of actions that they participate in. They may know that some actions such as eating beef is bad for the environment, but most people wouldn't know the actual statistics and magnitude of harm this particular action brings to the environment. Of course, there will always be individuals who know the consequences but choose to remain ignorant in order to live life conveniently. However, I believe if everyone was thoroughly educated on this issue, at least the majority will make changes to benefit the greater good of humanity. At this point, I wonder why the facts regarding the climate crisis aren't common knowledge. I feel as if there are powerful entities working directly against us in promoting awareness. If we are currently in the 6th mass extinction stage, people everywhere deserves to know what is happening before humanity gets wiped clean.

Before, I knew that people need to address the problem of climate crisis both personally and collectively to make it effective. However, I didn’t know that these two ways can be linked, or with the efforts of climate activists and voting of the public, a personal environment-friendly action can trigger the change in the level of politics and society, which then become a collective climate action. Copenhagen which mentioned in Ken’s lecture is a good example. In the past, it was also very inconvenient and unsafe for people to ride bicycles on the road of Denmark. However, with the efforts of environmental activists, the cultural change of building safe bike lanes and riding bikes to other places was made. Right now, there is roughly 62 percent of the people who lived in Copenhagen commute to work or school by bike. With the calculation which Ken mentioned in his lecture that if the same number of people in America adapt to bicycles traveling every year like Copenhagen, about 3.8 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emission will be reduced. As a result, the US or even the world should consider the accessibility of building safe and convenient bike lanes, and other political changes that are a benefit for the environment.
<br><br>
However, this is not to say that personal actions like switching to a plant-based diet or wasting less food are not worth doing, after all, about 28 percent of methane emission in the US come from meat productions and food waste accounts for 8 percent of global emission. It is to say that combine both personal and political changes in the level of society the problem of climate change can be successfully addressed, for the reason that “civilizations reliance on fossil fuel for energy and transport [also] accounts for roughly two-thirds of global greenhouse emissions,” as Ken mentioned in his lecture.

I completely agree with your comment about the linkage of personal and collective action about combating climate change and I really liked your example of Copenhagen like Ken talked about. While many people would not be opposed to biking or public transportation, it's not a good option due to our infrastructure. Our cities are made for driving, making biking unsafe like how Ken discussed the deaths of bikers in Santa Barbara as they are only given a painted line to separate them from the cars. My dad wants to bike more around town but he can't get over how unsafe it is to bike in an LA suburb where the only option is to bike in the street with the cars. The system is not set up for us to even have the choice of opting out of cars as you risk your safety with it. That is when activism and exercising your political voice through voting is so important and comes into play. Local, state and federal government are not going to change if there is no pressure or said demand for it. If people took to the streets or started petitions for bike paths or voted people out of office who are not committed to creating a greener society, then there is prospect or change. Social movements can take time to achieve their goals so in the mean time it is imperative that we still make conscious decisions concerning our personal lives and the actions we take everyday. Just because you going vegan might not fix the world then, it is still a key thing to achieve the goals in the long run. Personal action, activism and political power all go hand in hand in creating meaningful social change. It takes personal action to become an activist and exercise your voting rights as well as encouraging others to do the same. Social change takes time and social movements truly can change the status quo but we have to remain diligent with our own personal actions as well as being active members in the community advocating for what we care about and voting to enact the change we want to see.

<p>
I believe that personal action, climate activism and becoming politically active are all important. I also believe that they are all entangled and show some forms of the other like Ken said. Not everyone is going to switch their diet or may not have the time to be an activist, but we all need to vote for bills and legislation that support climate activism or that makes personal action that much easier to do. We need to praise and support the people who are climate activists and the ones that are doing personal change. That way, overtime culture slowly develops and creates sustainable living. By voting we can create change. Some people will not vote for environmental causes unless you convince them to do so. This is done through climate activism and showing personal action. Someone might be politically active but voting the wrong direction and will change their vote if they are persuaded to do so by climate activists. We need a combination of all three in order to save our planet!

Yes! Even though everything we do makes a difference, those little differences aren’t going to solve the climate crisis. What’s going to solve the climate crisis is legislation. And the only way to do that is through activism. We need people to go out and vote. We need to show politicians that we value our right to vote and that our votes matter. We need to educate our friends and family, and urge them to vote. No matter how much we change about ourselves and our lifestyles on an individual level, it will never amount to the change necessary to create lasting positive change. That can only be done through legislation. And to be honest, taking an hour to go vote is the easiest and simplest change we can implement. That being said, I still do think people should be making those individual changes too. It isn’t one or the other that’s going to solve everything. As you mentioned, it’s all of them, government action, personal action, and social pressure, put together. We can’t just focus on one thing anymore. It’s too late for that. We have to do everything we can. Collectively. Attending this school gives me hope for that, as I’ve noticed so many different initiatives being taken to get as many people as possible registered to vote. At the begin of last quarter, my residence hall hosted a mandatory meeting where everyone got a chance to register to vote. Last week, I saw people by the Arbor asking passing students if they’d registered to vote. That’s the kind of collective action we need to be taking on all fronts. We need to spread our knowledge, because as Ken has said in the past, if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered. Change starts through personal action which inspires collective action which influences the polls and eventually, if done correctly, leads to the correct people in office who determine how our nation is going to change.

I personally think that personal actions, climate activism, and political action are all important to mitigating the climate crisis. They are all fragments of a puzzle that are all interrelated as stated by Ken. Copenhagen serves as a prime example of the domino effect starting with personal actions towards climate activism, and then political action. In calling attention to the climate crisis by making lifestyle changes and using our voices, it’s possible to create a sweeping cultural change, even within a small population. Additionally, Ken mentions that voting is an integral part of enacting change, as the leaders of our country are the ones that determine the population’s practices. If we are able to vote candidates into office, then we can help determine the future of our nation, as well as our future on a global scale. In response to the use of electric bikes, I think it’s fairly efficient and possible for America to make this change. Not to mention the major health benefits that would incur as a result. Since UCSB is a flat campus that is biker-friendly, the transition is definitely easier in our case. For those that do not live in areas where roads are designed for bikers, this may be unattainable. But, I bring up personal actions and voting yet again. These solutions combined could create a powerful effect.

<p>
I completely agree that personal action, and climate and political activism are all integral to ensuring that we combat the climate crisis properly. I could flip the scenario around and say everyday we are calling our politicians and spreading the news, we are working towards a goal of being able to make the personal actions that we so desire to do. I think in the past few weeks of this course we’ve been given different problems and solutions that slowly each of us have interpreted and put together ourselves. However the discussion of the intermingling of personal action and political and climate activism is the key to piecing everything together and now we can look at everything we’ve learned in a holistic way. 
<br><br>

Personal action is important. But as Ken addressed, how are people going to switch to bikes if there’s no safe bike lanes? Or be their own electricity provider when for an individual, it can be costly and confusing to maneuver because alternative energy sources are not readily accessible to the regular individual. We need the infrastructure to support personal action first and foremost and that goes with being an activist in every aspect possible. I think it’s almost a win-win for most people to be activists because they can get to see change and help combat the climate crisis while being informed about what their politicians are doing especially in other areas that they’re passionate about such as labor. No matter what area of activism you focus on, one way or another, you are helping to combat the climate crisis .

I fully believe that personal action, climate activism, and being politically active are all essential to saving the planet. If you can't back up your activism with personal actions, no one will believe you have the drive. If you aren't promoting climate activism, no bills will ever be made. If you don't vote for bills that help your personal changes, those changes are ever the more difficult. They are three sides of the same issue, the holy trinity if you will.
<br><br>
When it comes to bikes, I adore the bike lanes on campus here at UCSB, yet even right off-campus in Isla Vista, I do not feel safe biking. Sure, it's better than downtown Goleta, or Santa Barbara, but there are still 800-pound death machines hurtling past you constantly, with little thought for how they affect bikers. IV is plagued with streets without sidewalks or bike lanes, or cars that decide to just park in the middle of the road. It's less of a safe commute and more of a game of Hopper. So, how can we as residents of UCSB and IV fix that?
<br><br>
Personal action: Bike. It's simple, but it's true. Ditch the car and bike. If politicians see that the community bikes, they'll be more likely to support bikers.
<br><br>
Climate activism: Call or email local representatives. Let them know you want biking infrastructure. And I'm not saying I support guerilla activism but a few citizen made bike paths could do us some good. A few less signs in strip malls that say no biking wouldn't hurt anyone.
<br><br>
Political action: You already know this one: vote! Vote for climate activists and politicians of the people, as well as bills that help your cause.
<br><br>
I think the core of this idea can be applied to a multitude of climate issues.

I really like how you illustrated the interconnectivity about the three main things Ken says we should do to fight the climate crisis. I agree with you that biking in Isla Vista is less safe than on campus, but I think most people driving cars in Isla Vista know that bikers have the right of way. That being said though, I think many people including you would feel a lot better/safer about biking in IV if bike lanes were more obvious or even completely separate from the roads, as they are on campus. I also think the lack of sidewalks in IV is a problem. At night on the weekends when students on foot are flooding the streets, those walkers, bikers, and car drivers are all using the same medium to transport themselves. That is not safe, especially when most of the streets in Isla Vista already appear narrow because of the number of cars parked on the side of the streets.
<br><br>


Your comment using biking as an example of a climate-related issue definitely resonated with me and made me motivated to be active regarding climate issues in general. Although Ken's personal example made sense to me when he was talking about biking to campus from Santa Barbara, what you bring up is more familiar to me. I think if we can start small with climate activism at a local level, then it's only a matter of time and further support for others to publicly advocate for political decisions to be made in favor of the environment. But as you mentioned, each of the three components Ken describes is interdependent on each other and necessary to make change the fastest and most efficient way.

In my opinion, I believe personal action is the best and matters the most. Protesting and complaining honestly does nothing and instead that energy should be put towards action. I am tired of people talking about change instead of taking the necessary steps in actually making a difference. I myself have already adjusted the way I live so that the planet does not become further damaged. I no longer purchase clothing and other items with a consumerist mindset. When I buy an item, I ponder on how long it will serve me and that dictates whether or not I will actually purchase it. I no longer want to contribute to the consumerist mindset, instead I want to live a minimalist lifestyle. I have also decided to no longer ride planes for transportation. I’d rather travel by train because less CO2 emissions will be put out into the planet’s atmosphere. I do not think climate activism and becoming politically active is a complete waste of time, however, I don’t think it is the best thing to do. Why hasn’t climate activism or political action helped in the past? There have been many protests in the past, yet we still have many issues today. I hope more people take action to improve the planet’s current state. Thank you, Ken, for acknowledging the mistakes of your generation and I hope it does not weigh on you too heavy, because it is not your fault. I respect you for everything you have done in trying to help bring awareness to the climate crisis.

Obviously, confronting the gorilla in the room should be our top priority, as the longer it takes, the more it will counteract and nullify our personal actions. One's behavior charcateristics are only slightly helpful in the grand scheme of things. However, by changing our habits and adopting new lifestyles, this helps to signal to politicians and the government of the importance of these issue, helping create legislation and passing climate justice laws. So the action is not as important as the symbol of the action, that will help instigate real change through persuading representatives and elected officials that have the means to do so. Likewise, it seems much easier and more effective for our nation to vote in favor of those campaigning with regards to environmental equality than to change their culture and lifestyles. Instead of ranking these in hierarchical order, lets focus on how they can connect and intertwine with each other to do the most. One can become a climate activist by their personal neutral actions to push for a change in government policy.

I agree with you that it will take a combination of both personal activism and widespread voting to make real changes in our country. We must be willing to change anything and everything necessary to progress climate change efforts, even if it is uncomfortable and annoying to make these lifestyle shifts. In regards to biking everywhere in an effort to reduce greenhouse emissions, I am in full support that making this change more widespread would not only benefit the climate but would cause society to be happier and healthier and would increase travel safety with the reduction of car accidents. In my own hometown of Roseville, California, however, much effort would be necessary to make safe and complete bike paths, as there is definitely a lack of them at the moment. By implementing a system like Copenhagen’s carless Sundays, society might have the ability to be eased into relying on bikes and other alternative measures for transportation, which would be very beneficial in spreading awareness of such means. I personally would be less likely to take the bus to go somewhere unless it was my only choice.


<br><hr>
There should be a byciclism movement in America to promote the win win mentality of biking to work, and everywhere else. Much like how we do biking at UCSB, hopefully the rest of the nation can catch on. of course there are still cars in IV, and they are useful for important occasions and rarities where people need to get transported a long distance quickly. But for everyday events, like going to class, running errands, and meeting people, bikes are the perfect substitute. They provide a source of exercise, fun in the fresh-air, and are environmentally friendly. 

<br><br>
The baby boomer generation are the adults Mr. Hiltner has been apologizing for on their behalf. Even if they are not willing to change their lifestyles, widespread voting with their support would be very influential. For those non-believers too stubborn to make sacrifices like the rest of us, spending an hour a year at the polling place is my only request.

I believe that personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active are all intertwined. Depending on who you vote for that is a big step in both climate and personal action. On the other hand the government will not do everything for us (although the Green New Deal is going to be big help), so that is where personal action comes in and we must change out lifestyles to benefit the climate. Speaking about Denmark and “grassroots action” was a good point for me. I believe that we need to all take action on our own and make the change we need to see. Living in Isla Vista there is no reason for a car considering how close to campus you are and how careless the pedestrians are (sorry not sorry, I am one). Such a small change can have a powerful impact, and when I say that I mean everywhere, which again shows how personal action, climate activism, and politics are all connected. Change to a plant based diet, pick up trash you see laying on the ground, vote with the Green New Deal in mind and find out what else you can do in the community to make the biggest impact possible.

I believe the role of personal action, climate activism, or being politically active is not the multiple choice question. Those three roles do not conflict with each other. Like the video said, personal action is more like a daily action. It forms your daily habit, your lifestyle. Climate activism is the advanced level of personal action. Because only you have the personal action, then you have the chance of being climate activism. If you do nothing in your daily life, how could you become the climate activist? Meanwhile, being politically active and climate activism are two different roads, but only if they cooperate, it is easier to achieve the goal. Ken said that American don't have a good system for cyclists. So climate activism will raise this problem, and being politically active will solve this problem.

All the personal actions combined are not enough to reduce climate change compared with the burning of fossil fuel and the beef industries, which cause 2/3 of CO2. This fact may reduce many's incentives to protect the environment because, after so many things they have done, it turns out to contribute almost no effect on the Earth. In fact, if everyone becomes vegan, it is still not enough to control the rise of the temperature. Besides, it is impossible to expect everyone to think about climate change and take action. For example, many people in the past generation won't agree to move to small houses. Just imagine every day you take the bike from home to school and on the side of the road is the factory that emits black smoke, how would you feel? Since the climate crisis is an urgent problem and there is not much time left, we should do something that hits the key point. We can start by solving the biggest two causes. For instance, voting to pass a policy that relates to this issue.

I see you point of how not everybody cares about climate change and there's no way people could think about it 24/7 as it would only cause them to disengage from the problem psychologically, but I think both individual actions and bigger policy changes are essential in order to tackle the problems of climate change. Based on the current political dynamics of the United States, it could be very difficult to pass policies that aim to preserve the environment and mitigate potential ramification of climate change because energy companies have invested a lot of money on lobbying groups and politicians. Of course, best case scenario is big policy gets passed, but what happens if that progress is stagnated? It then comes down to individual actions that try to reduce carbon footprints, and I think we should definitely put more emphasis on educating the public about individual actions.

I agree that political activism, climate activism, and personal actions are integrally related. Personal actions can sway other people’s opinions about political changes. For instance, Obama’s cap and trade was accepted at first, but fossil fuel companies convinced the public that it would violate their freedom. I think if there were more people to say that it’s cool, more people would follow. Political action is needed too, through voting and pressuring politicians. If Copenhagen can reduce their CO2 by 3.8Billion pounds/year in about 3 decades, so can we. I would like better biking structures. It’d be fun, convenient, and helping the environment since fossil fuels accounts for ⅔ of global greenhouse gas, more methane is emitted through fracking than beef, and 4.6lb CO2/year/american comes from driving. Yeah, we can make the personal change and eat less beef, but it’s not as efficient as doing it with not fracking. Not eating beef would remind you that you’re doing this for the environment, and when you compare the effort you put into not eating beef to the effort needed to vote, you’re more likely to vote. We didn’t commit to change in 1973 with the energy crisis when we should have, like Denmark did. We have to commit to change now with the climate crisis, with vanguards and voters. Our current biking infrastructure isn’t just a climate issue. It’s also a social one. Cyclists are just as important as vehicle drivers. Why are bike lanes protecting parked cars on the side from 50mph traffic? I want high speed rails like the ones in Japan. I wanna have fun biking, and not have to go against everything. It felt gross, driving when I could bus or bike instead, but busing would take too long and biking is dangerous. It felt gross driving around while practicing for my behind the wheel test, where one second of driving=a whole day of not charging, emissions wise. But that’s the way things are, and it’s dangerous and inconvenient to go against it.

I think if people came together to fight this climate issue, we have a better shot at making progress. That's pretty obvious but it's a hard task to get people to believe and especially care for the planet. It's pretty frustrating to me to hear that changing our diet and using alternative methods of transportation instead of cars, isn't enough. I take the climate crisis very seriously and therefore I am always advocating for change and I'm always sharing what I know with whoever is willing to hear me out. I don't expect to change people right away but I do expect people to be aware of the issue and learn to be more considerate of others and the planet. Our actions affect one another, especially the actions of developed countries on developing countries. We can't continue to be so ignorant and selfish to each other like that, it's not very human-like. 
<br><br>
I think anyone who really cares about the planet is a climate activist because unknowingly we bring the issue up in our conversations with our peers. I think it's powerful and brave when people talk about the issue. Many people still go "ugh" or simply stop paying attention when the climate crisis is brought up. Why? Why is this issue an issue? So many people have a problem with it and what's worse is that some people think about it as a debate and some people will not change their beliefs and their habits, simply to stand their ground of not caring, it's unbelievable. I'm not exactly sure to what degree climate activism helps since a lot of our voices are ignored or silences, but I don't think we should stop talking about it simply because people tell us not to.

Ken is right that it can be hard to make certain personal changes because the alternatives to our norm are often times not practical. This is why voting and climate activism can be hugely important. We need certain legislation and legal changes to be made to create safer, more efficient alternatives in order to help our environment in a doable way. Where I’m from in Orange County it is unsafe in most areas to get around using anything but a car. Bike lanes are extremely lacking, and public transportation is also an unreliable option. After moving to Isla Vista, a college town with safe routes for bicycles, it has been easy to give up my car. I bike everywhere around town and even if I need to get somewhere farther away, the bus is super easy to navigate or ride shares are always available on Facebook which take advantage of carpooling. It’s a college town so many of these conveniences have I’m sure developed for that reason, but it’s shown me how having a doable and efficient alternative makes an environmentally conscious switch so much easier. I don’t feel like I need a car here because it’s so easy to get around without one, whereas at home it would be a huge effort to figure out what alternative modes of transportation I could use to get around and in a safe and efficient way. Copenhagen is an inspiring example of how much easier it is for people to change their lifestyles when the government is in full support too. That was a major culture change brought about by bicycle environmental activists so activism can play a big role in obtaining government support. I think people could actually enjoy some of the changes we have to make as a result of the climate crisis if the government makes them easier and more appealing. No one wants to struggle or make a change that will affect the comfort in their daily lives. We are all busy and changes like that sound extremely unappealing. I think people would love riding their bikes or taking public transit systems to work if it was an easy switch!

It’s frustrating to me when people say that one person’s changes will not make a difference, and the reason why it frustrates me so much is because it’s true to some extent. One person becoming vegan will have nearly no effect, given that even if every single person on the planet went vegan we still would not be meeting our climate change goals. One person deciding to ditch their car, their big house, excessive shopping habits, and every single other bad environmental habit may reduce their carbon footprint drastically but it will not even dent the overall global footprint. However even though I believe that one person’s actions won’t make a difference, I believe that one person can also make all the difference. I know that sentence made no sense, but it’s what I meant. 
<br><br>

Actions rub off on other people. If one person makes all of these changes, likely their friends and families will too, and their friends and their family and so on. One person making a conscious decision to make environmentally friendly choices is a form of activism in itself. Although attending a climate march of course is a more obvious form of activism, drawing attention to the problem in any form is beneficial. Friends seeing the actions another person is making will likely cause them to make those actions as well. It is calling attention in a subtle yet effective way. More and more people voluntarily doing this will hopefully turn into political change and mandatory actions. Voting for candidates who support mitigating climate change is the only way to actually mitigate climate change. However the way to get the votes will be by people seeing personal changes and activism. So even though one person’s climate change “won’t make a difference”, it will get the ball rolling to make all the difference.

I really agree with what you've said in your comment. It can truly be disheartening to feel like you are making changes to try and combat climate change, and yet you don't see the result of those changes due to the actions of the masses. I agree that a single American cannot make a huge difference, however one person can make a statement. One person can choose to show others the correct and right way to do things, to be an example so to speak. As you stated actions rub off on other people, through this idea hopeful we can start a chain reaction of change. 
<br><br>
Although I think voting is really important I disagree with Ken that it is the most important thing to do to combat climate change. However it is the most influential thing to do in the current world we live in. In a ideal scenario people would be able to make choices and then those choices would then be reflected by our current politicians who are trying to appease voters therefore making politicians truly public servants again. However I realize we don't live in this ideal world, therefor voting for people who believe in the climate crisis and are eager to fight against it should be supported. Especially if they have a passion and it is clear that they won't drop this issue once they are elected into office like so many politicians do.


<br><hr>

I completely agree! Humans are social creatures, and we definitely learn by watching others. I know that if I made an effort to practice more sustainable living and shared my progress with them, I know they would start to do the same. During my senior year of high school, I made an effort to be healthier, and as soon as my results started to show, a lot of my friends at the time started being healthier themselves and telling me about their progress! It's definitely up to us to start practicing what we preach, in order to create the motivation for change from others. I mean, social media is a huge way to start influencing others to live more sustainably. "Influencers" impact what people buy, what they wear, what they eat. Our actions are so important, now more than ever!

<br><br>

Climate activism starts with us, one change at a time. Whether it's spreading information to others, or making lifestyle choices, or going to climate change rallies and protests, we have to start, and we have to start now. The voter registration deadline is soon!! And with that brings hopefully monumental change. We just need to inspire each other to make a difference. I believe voting is so important, it can quite literally change the tide! With leaders that believe in the same climate goals, we can implement such projects as safer/more bike lanes! And if people start using them and inspiring others to make the same commute, who knows what the impact will be! We can definitely change the impact of the "gorilla" in the room, but it starts with individual actions. So maybe one person going vegan isn't saving the entire planet, I do think it is a good start, and at least they're doing something. I think small efforts can add up to immeasurable amounts!

I think that the topic of personal action, climate activism, or becoming politically active and which one is the most effective really plays into how much someone cares/desires for change in this world. Truth be told, not everyone in this world is a climate activist on a political scale leading rallies and initiating change. Most people are somewhat passive observers of the impending problems that climate change will bring to this planet sometime in the near future. But, this doesn’t mean that people who fit this mold don’t care at all. My friends for the most part are like this, but that doesn’t mean they don’t appreciate going to the beach and taking a hike where trash doesn’t litter every tree trunk. I know they care enough to pick something up or to not litter because it is sort of looked down upon to do that anymore. What I’m trying to say from all of this is that the most important thing for anyone’s impact on the climate is literally anything that puts the planets well being over personal selfishness of not caring for the environment.

Personal cultural changes and actions are not enough to mitigate the climate crisis. Only energy in transport produces greenhouses such as CO2and methane gas that greatly harm our planet.. About 28% methane emissions come from the meat industry. Fracking is the biggest methane emitter, and which personal action has no influence on, thus we need alternatives that can come about to substitute the fracking industry. Half of the oil and ⅔ of the gas produced from the US in fracked. We need to vote and support legislators that agree with climate change. Need to address these issues to our politicians. Even though personal actions might not seem as though they help we should continue to advocate these changes and to use our voice to advocate for the climate crisis. Voting for candidates advocating to sweep climate change policies such as Green New Deal. Also, spread what we have learned to others. However, as we have learned even if people decided to bike rather than drive, our cities and the world are not prepared for that. Thus the Green New Deal offers the implementation of zero emission infrastructure that could support an eco friendly environment, where every community could function as well as any other. Local, national, state elections play a huge role in mitigating climate change so we must vote and demand the change we want to see.

<p>
Many people will say that you cannot be considered an environmentalist if you do not live an environmentally conscious lifestyle.  They may point to someone eating meat, driving a car as a primary means of transportation or any number of other non climate friendly things as examples of hypocrisy and not actually making a difference.  The scene from last weeks movie Cowspiracy  in which the older man stated that no one can be non-vegan and still consider themselves an environmentalist is a great example of such.  I personally think that way of thinking is bullshit, and Ill outline why.
<br><br>


The majority of Americans are not environmental activists.  A majority of those people likely never will be environmental activists, or frankly even care about the environment outside of their direct life at all.  They want to live in a huge house, drive a Hummer, eat as much meat as they want and buy whatever they can.  And while you, and many other people, could sacrifice many of the luxuries you enjoy and live the most environmentally conscious lives possible, there will still be that majority of Americans completely offsetting any good you are doing with their enormous and unchecked climate footprints.
<br><br>


This brings me to my second point.  The obvious counter argument to what I said above is that, well, how can we expect them to change without first setting an example ourselves?  How can we get them to recognize the harm they are doing and stop it, except by showing the truly environmentally conscious way to live from our own lives and pressuring them to lives lives as such?  An approach like this won't work.  Many people cling to their ways of life as an essential part of their identity, and attempts to morally force them to change will only be met with further denial of the problem.  Attempts to persuade or direct challenges to their actions will cause even more climate denial and ultimately undermine the cause we are fighting for in the first place.
<br><br>


What needs to be done is a re-framing of the issue.  Right now it is rightfully accusatory, accusing Americans and other first world nations and peoples that they have been the ones primarily responsible for the destruction of our planet, and because of it they need to change.  But this approach, as valid as it may be, frankly won't work.  In order for truly meaningful legislative action to be taken on the climate crisis we need to approach the issue primarily politically.  We need to get Americans to believe that although they may have been contributing to the climate crisis through their actions, those actions were not the result of lack of morality or care.  They live the way the do because that is the life they know, and what has been available.  The problem isn't that they live the way they do, it's that by continuing to do so will result in unimaginable disasters globally for the planet and them directly in the future.  They need to be convinced that whatever change they need to make will be much easier to live with than a world in chaos and environmental disaster.  
<br><br>


Even if they are convinced that the climate crisis is real and will effect them, they still may not change their individual lives directly, and frankly that is alright.  What is most important is that they can be convinced it is an issue they should care about politically, and are willing to vote to be regulated in a way they cannot do so themselves.  Getting climate deniers to become voters of the green new deal is the only meaningful way we will be able to solve this global problem, as hard of a task as that may be.

I don't think that we can compare between personal action, climate activism,  or becoming politically active as something that matters more or less. Obviously, your vote for a green candidate will make a bigger difference, but you can't just vote green and then enjoy a burger afterward. We should all strive to have better lifestyles, to fight for what we believe is right and do everything that we can to help our planet. little things help. Even though a burger might seem tiny compared to the consequences of fracking, it still contributes to the problem as it costs about 660 gallons of water/ burger. We must also keep in mind to practice what we preach, so save our planet by going vegan, by activism, by voting. We can't just decide that one is more important than the others and forgo the rest. All steps must be taken for true progress. The same can be thought of for bicycle tracks, also. People like the comforts of their cars. Before I came to UCSB, I refused to bike to school because it was tiring and I would get all sweaty and I would also have to leave early from my house to go. A car was just so much more convenient. But now that I am here and the only way to get around is through biking, my views on bikes have changed drastically into a much more positive one. Maybe if we push legislation to make bike paths the prioritized path, people will be more likely to use it because using a car would be more of a hassle. People will be mad, for sure, but I hope they will realize the beauty of the world around them when they use their bikes, just like I did when I first used mine at UCSB.

Ken said it best when he said personal action, climate activism, and political action are important and connected. I believe that political and climate activism are of the most important because I feel like they can create a lot more beneficial change. While it will take personal action to make climate and political action happen it will be really helpful if we had leaders that understood climate change is real and needs attention. All these are important to help during the climate crisis and hopefully will gain momentum to become people’s main goal. I feel like personal action will be the easiest to do from the three as it is about changing your own habits and is more doable. If we have a better understanding of how we are harming the earth personal action will be the first thing people will resort to make a change.

I agree. Political and climate action are extremely important. Like Ken said, voting only takes an hour out of your day and can do wonders in changing the course of not only society, but also the future of our planet. This election season is going to be the most important of our generation, it is critical that we all go out and keep the sustainability of our planet in mind when casting a vote. I liked Ken’s example of Mark Ruffalo’s documentary targeted at Governor Brown to stop fracking along the California coast. We need people who will not tolerate this type of environmental destruction. These politicians need to be punished by being voted out of office. 
<br><br>
Personal action is the major drive for this type of change despite what people may think. Yes I agree that the personal decision to switch to a plant based diet won’t make much of a difference as much as a whole state doing it, there’s still motivation behind these choices. You are right, personal action is the easiest thing to do when we have a better understanding of what is going on. Just like when I learned how detrimental the beef crisis is on the environment,  We need motivation to be applied to the political aspect of the climate crisis. We need to attack that “gorilla in the room” head on with this motivation and drive to want to see a healthy planet for not only our generation but many generations to come.


<br><hr>
I agree with what you said, personal action, political action and climate activism are the most important things to focus on because like Professor Hiltner said they are all connected. You cannot have one without the other, they go hand in hand and work together to make changes. Although it is true climate change is not and should not be considered a political issue, it unfortunately is. If we want change then our government needs to implement those changes and pass laws that will enforce those changes. In order for political action to occur we need to personally get involved and demand changes from our government officials, by doing this we are taking our futures in our own hands. On top of this individuals need to make life changes like being vegan, drive less, and recycle everything possible, but it is clear that this is not enough. Although these are wonderful things to do, they do not have a huge impact on our current crisis. This is why climate activism is really important. Individuals who do want change need to band together to create movements and get the attention of those who have power in our government. As well as getting the attention of big corporations. When the public bands together and says they will boycott companies like target or Walmart because of their impacts on the environment, then eventually those companies may make changes to please their consumers. We have more power than we think, if we come together and demand change then things will start to get better environmentally.

I agree! We need to come together and have our voice heard so we can have a more sustainable planet. The more people that band together the more possible it will be for big companies like the ones you mentioned to make.a change. it may seem like our voices will not matter to the big companies but it’s worth a try.
<br><hr>
We are back to the old state again. The old state of finding others problems and finding solutions for others. NO! Find our own problems. Start change from ourselves. Don’t always find others problem. We are part of the human beings on the Earth. Ken’s generation know to admit their failure. They are courageous. We should learn from them. We didn’t do everything eco-friendly. We have a lot of smokers around us (people should know that smoking is bad for the atmosphere). Stop smoking. Save food in the dining common. The future of the Earth depends on us, not others.
<br><hr>
Like Ken mentioned, not one is a better choice than the other, all three are connected and contribute significantly to the climate crisis. We shouldn't look at one as the better option than the other, because if we then do this, we ignore the other solutions and therefore wouldnt see much change. I agree with what you said about needing more leaders that are not only aware of the climate crisis but also wanting to fight for actual change. It is one thing for someone to be knowledgeable on climate change but it is another thing to actually go out and do something about it. Like Ken previously mentioned a few weeks ago, “if acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squandered.” We must all make personal changes even if the statistics show that they won't make as big as an impact to our earth compared to fighting fossil fuels - we shouldn't let this discourage us. If anything it should encourage us to go out and not only take on climate activism but go out there and be politically active as well. In my opinion, I believe being politically active is easier than personal changes. Like Ken said, it only takes one hour of our day to go out there and vote. We just need to make sure we know who/what we are voting for and the impacts it will have on us, and not let the crap we see in the media confuse us because that is their goal. They want to make this a left versus right issue when that shouldn't even be taken into consideration.
<br><hr>
I agree with the idea that don’t choose a better/best option, because they are all good options. Also, I guess this is more likely a political game rather than crap from the media. Power is very addictive and corrosive when it controls people. Therefore, people with power need other people to hold them account. This is exactly the relation between the press and president. The president plays political game to earn money and ignores the people and the Earth (environment). If so, the press must stand out and tell the public that the president is not behaving well. Protecting the environment is the most important task right now, and everyone should take part in this task.

Personal action is important; its effects should not be negated and its relevance to each individual should continue to be promoted. If someone bikes to work every day instead of driving but still eats a 6 ounce steak for dinner, their environmental impact is still going to be a lot more than if they enjoyed a primarily plant based diet. Suggesting that personal action is not as relevant as other types of activism manifests hopelessness and confusion. As such a large scale issue demanding attention from so many aspects of our lives,  it is important to contribute in every way possible to its solution. I'm scared to say this but, given my personal situation right now, I am a lot more confident in the effect that my personal action can have right now over my political action or activism. As a new participant in American politics, I am just a bit confused. Last year I tried my hardest to be an educated voter, but as I filled out my ballot, I left a lot of options blank because I didn't know how they aligned with my beliefs or if I even understood them in the first place. 
<br><br>
With that being said, if my ballot had an option that said "Make Santa Barbara bike paths look like Copenhagen", I'd bubble that in in a heartbeat. I acknowledge grand change such as biking infrastructure can only result from higher power; it is much less likely to be something resulting from personal action. With environmental changes becoming accessible and appealing, they would be a lot more likely to take hold of a society than if those choices were the underdog. McDonald's and Taco Bell are much more convenient than the little veggie restaurant in the corner of town. As soon as big change begins to occur collectively, I believe the momentum could carry us all in an amazing direction. But this can't really happen without activism and awareness. Personal action, activism, and politics are all an integral part of working towards a sustainable future, I don't think any can be prioritized while ignoring another and generate as grand of a result.

During the lecture video, Ken brought up that even if everyone went vegan it wouldn’t be “enough,” and it made me think of how we often have this mentality of always doing the most minimum thing possible in order to reach or achieve what needs to get done. I feel as though this same mentality is being connected between veganism and the climate crisis, essentially most people are thinking all they have to do to save the planet from the climate crisis is cut out some beef or go vegetarian or vegan and their job is done. However, this is not the case, we need to go beyond our expectations of enough because if we don’t, we will fall short. In order to help solve this climate crisis, we need to address the elephant in the room, fossil fuels. Many of us don’t want to address the idea of fossil fuels because after all it is a part of our everyday lives in one way or another for energy and transportation. Unfortunately, issues such as fracking cannot be changed individually, thus our future somewhat depends on politicians to do something. One of the solutions to the climate crisis that doesn’t require too much of your devoted time is voting. If you truly want to put an end to the climate crisis, we need policies to change. Basically, we must vote for local and federal candidates that advocate for sweeping climate change policies such as carbon pricing and the Green New Deal. As Ken mentions, we can take a step further by explaining to about 5 more friends or family the importance of voting.
<br><br>
It’s crazy but unsurprising at this point that the average American’s car use equals about ¼ of their personal carbon footprint. At first I was confused why Ken gave the solution of e-bikes, in other words hybrid bikes, since I knew his thoughts on hybrid cars. However, it made more sense as to why when he explained that a hybrid bike with a propulsion system is not like a hybrid car. This is because instead of being powered by an electric motor and a gasoline engine like a hybrid car, a hybrid bike is powered by an electric motor and the person’s pedaling. Until Ken brought it up in lecture and again in this video, I never realized how important it would be to have something that separates the bike lane from the cars other than a white painted line. Only having a white painted line separate the two is dangerous because the bicyclists are pedaling near cars going up to speeds such as 50 mph in certain places. There have been victory stories advocating for this bike lane change. For instance, in Copenhagen, ⅔ of people now commute to work or school by bike. It’s important to note that the whole concept of getting to places daily by bike was extremely foreign to Copenhagen until about 1973, meaning it’s possible to have behavioral change beyond the individual level. Another victory would be in the 1970s when there were car free Sundays to conserve oil reserves. I’m really interested to see what alternatives people mainly chose for these car free sundays, did they take public transportation, did they walk, did they bike, or did most just stay home? A different victory was referred to as operation white crosses, where white crosses were painted on the street where cyclists had been killed in traffic. Although this was meant to encourage safer bike lanes, I feel as though it may have scared people from the idea of biking at all or caused people to not bike at all in the meantime and use their cars. Without political activism in these situations there would not have been these victories. Iorder to answer Ken’s question at the end of the video, I believe that political activism should and can play a big role in the climate crisis.

It's quite true that personal action, climate activism, and, ultimately, political action are connected. I believe that they all feed into each other. Individuals must first take on a cause and make an effort to change their lives to line up with that cause. Those who wish to mitigate the climate crisis may start to drive less, eat a vegan diet and recycle whenever possible. And, like Ken said, all of those things are wonderful, but they aren't enough to fully attack the climate crisis. These individual initiatives need to grow into larger movements to grab the attention of large groups of the population as well as political representatives. Events like the Climate March in DC make it evident that hundreds of thousands of people, just in that area, care about what is happening to our planet. However, the final level, which is likely the most crucial is political action. In order to make changes to the fossil fuel processes in the US and around the world we need political leaders to set up laws and limits surrounding fracking, the fashion industry, etc. In order for this to happen, the voices and efforts of individuals need to come together to be louder and larger than the wallets of the fossil fuel companies. This ultimately cycles back to personal action. If enough people begin to care about the environment, movements will grow and politicians will have to listen.

I agree with you and Ken about how important it is to understand the connection between personal action, climate activism, and becoming politically active. This world is in our hands, going vegan is not enough. A small thing of what we can control is our consumption and our transportation. Our civilization depends on fossil fuel for car use and this method is not sustainable. We need to switch to bicycle use. To encourage people to bike and feel safe, new designs should be placed to give bicyclists a protected road to be able to bike. Ken mentioned State st., which I have been to on multiple occasions. It is very busy and there are many cars so I can’t imagine biking there on a regular basis. We need to eliminate the consumption of meat or at least one day of the week. People also need to vote on policies that support climate change. People also need to implement ideas and not just vote; for example, supporting and writing in policies such as carbon tax and the Green New Deal. It is possible to start making changes individually to help climate change. If everyone does something, a change will be made. It is all up to humans and how much we care about the environment and future generations.

I really appreciate your comment on this video because I think it is very insightful. Ken mentioned that personal action, climate activism, and political action are connected with each other. Indeed, all of them are important and indispensable to problem solving. First of all, like you said, “individuals must first take on a cause and make an effort to change their lives to line up with that cause.” Secondly, according to you, “these individual initiatives need to grow into larger movements to grab the attention of large groups of the population as well as political representatives.” Finally, “we need political leaders to set up laws and limits surrounding fracking, the fashion industry, etc.” Personal action, climate activism, and political action are all included in the process of solving climate problem. In your comment, you mentioned that “the voices and efforts of individuals need to come together to be louder and larger than the wallets of the fossil fuel companies.” These steps form a cycle which leads back to personal action. So in order to change the situation, we must take actions and make changes from ourselves immediately.

I really liked your comment and I totally agree with the statement that all three levels are interconnected and dependent on each other. The changes we make on an individual level may seem insignificant when trying to combat climate change but these changes lead to others following by example. Then over a certain amount of time these changes people make grow into movements that lead to protests and demonstrations that then ultimately leads to politicians sponsoring bills to accomplish the goals of their constituents. However,  I feel the greatest aspect of this cycle is the political action that people can take because ultimately all the changes we need to make are going to have to be written into some form of a law or bill and voted on and our only chance for success on this level is dependent on who and what we vote for. The current majority of politicians are afraid to make the necessary changes because they fear either losing lobbying funding or not being re-elected since fossil fuel and other polluting industries have caused these actions for speaking out. One case that Ken pointed out was that Governor Brown had the chance to cease future fracking in California, one of the most environmentally conscious voting states, yet didn't for possible economic growth. This shocked me because the last thing we need is more growth we need to learn to sustain with what we have and increase the value of the goods we have rather than increase the quantity we have and feed our consumerism addiction. The actions of Governor Brown could've been avoided per se if a more environmental candidate was elected as the new Governor Newsome. This is why if individuals start to educate themselves more on political candidates and their intentions reaching our goals to mitigate climate change will become a lot easier.
